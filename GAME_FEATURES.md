# Murmuration: Evolution Game Features

## Core Gameplay Improvements

### 1. Level Reset System ‚úÖ
- Complete cleanup between attempts
- Proper state management
- No lingering effects from previous runs
- Memory cleared for fresh starts

### 2. Distinct Hazard Behaviors ‚úÖ

#### üå™Ô∏è Tornadoes
- **Confusion Effect**: Spins birds around, disrupts navigation
- **Energy Drain**: 1.5 energy/tick in danger zone
- **Kill Chance**: 10% at center (relatively low)
- **Visual**: Rotating spiral pattern with graduated danger zones
- **Strategy**: Avoid center, use beacons to guide around

#### ü¶Ö Predators  
- **Direct Pursuit**: Hunt specific targets
- **Panic Trigger**: Causes flock-wide panic when attacking
- **Kill Chance**: 20% when caught (high danger)
- **Reaction Chain**: Kill triggers major panic in 200-unit radius
- **Strategy**: Keep flock together, use scatter pulse when threatened

### 3. Visual Feedback System ‚úÖ

#### Graduated Danger Zones
- **Outer Zone** (1.5x radius): 20% danger - warning area
- **Middle Zone** (1.0x radius): 60% danger - active threat
- **Inner Zone** (0.5x radius): 100% danger - death zone

#### Beacon Influence Gradients
- Radial gradient showing influence strength
- Stronger effects at center
- Visual radius indicators
- Real-time tooltip showing danger levels

### 4. Evolution & Learning System ‚úÖ

#### Breed Traits
- **Hazard Awareness** (0-1): Detection range and reaction speed
- **Energy Efficiency** (0-1): Energy consumption rate
- **Flock Cohesion** (0-1): How tightly birds stick together
- **Beacon Sensitivity** (0-1): Response to player guidance
- **Stress Resilience** (0-1): Ability to handle danger

#### Evolution Mechanics
- Traits improve based on survival rate
- Experience affects specific adaptations:
  - Surviving tornadoes ‚Üí Better energy management
  - Escaping predators ‚Üí Improved awareness & cohesion
  - High survival ‚Üí Overall efficiency boost
  - Low survival ‚Üí Emergency adaptations

#### Generational Progress
- Each level completion evolves the breed
- Traits carry forward to next levels
- Visual generation counter
- Save/load breed data for persistent progress

### 5. Flock Reaction Behaviors ‚úÖ

#### Panic Response
- Triggered by predator attacks
- Intensity based on proximity to danger
- Scatter pattern away from threat
- Stress increase for affected birds

#### Close Calls
- Tracked for near-death experiences
- Affects breed evolution
- Displayed in UI statistics

#### Cohesion Dynamics
- Stronger with evolved breeds
- Affects survival in hazards
- Visual clustering behavior

## Game Progression

### Training Path
1. **W1-1: First Flight** - Learn basics
2. **W1-2: Predator Valley** - Master evasion
3. **W2-1: Storm Front** - Handle weather
4. **W2-2: The Gauntlet** - Mixed challenges
5. **W3-1: Migration Marathon** - Endurance test
6. **W3-2: Apex Predators** - Ultimate hunters
7. **W4-1: Perfect Storm** - Final challenge

### Victory Conditions

- Stress indicators on birds
- Particle effects for events

### User Experience
- Clear danger indicators
- Tooltips for hazard proximity
- Real-time breed statistics
- Evolution progress tracking
- Save/load functionality

## Strategy Guide

### Beacon Usage
- **Food**: Place along migration path for energy
- **Shelter**: Use near hazards to reduce stress
- **Thermal**: Boost through dangerous areas

### Hazard Management
- **Tornadoes**: Guide flock around edges, never through center
- **Predators**: Keep flock tight, use scatter pulse if caught

### Evolution Strategy
- Early generations: Focus on survival
- Mid generations: Optimize for efficiency
- Late generations: Perfect speedruns

### Advanced Techniques
- Beacon chaining for energy conservation
- Predictive hazard avoidance
- Pulse timing for maximum effect
- Sacrifice strategies for breed improvement

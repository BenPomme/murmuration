To help you best, could you confirm a few things:

Should I prioritize analyzing the code in the main branch, or is there another branch you want me to focus on?

For improving the visual quality with Phaser, do you want full-screen HD support with dynamic scaling across devices?

For the flocks’ ML evolution, are you currently using a specific ML library or technique in the codebase?

Should the FTUE tutorial be visual (in-game guidance) or text-based (e.g., overlay tips)?

Once I have this, I’ll do a full audit and create a structured implementation plan for your AI team.

Full Audit and Redesign of Murmuration Game

Murmuration Game Audit and Improvement Plan
Overview of Murmuration’s Current State
Murmuration is an “influence-not-control” flock evolution game where the player guides a migratory bird flock indirectly using environmental signals
GitHub
. Instead of steering birds directly, you place beacons (like food or shelter points) to influence their path, while avoiding blockers (hazards such as storms or predators) that threaten the flock
GitHub
GitHub
. The flock consists of ~80–300 autonomous birds (agents) with individual energy and stress levels and simple AI behaviors
GitHub
. A Python simulation backend runs the flock physics and evolution, and a TypeScript Phaser 3 client renders the action in real-time via WebSockets
GitHub
GitHub
. Currently the game includes multiple leveled scenarios (“contracts”) and an evolving breed system where bird traits improve across seasons based on survival
GitHub
GitHub
. Technical architecture: The client is built with Phaser 3 (WebGL) at a fixed 1280×720 canvas resolution, mapping a 2000×1200 world onto that canvas
GitHub
. This yields a working visualization, but it is not yet optimized for high-DPI displays or variable screen sizes. Many visual elements are placeholder or simplistic (e.g. birds are rendered as small colored circles, hazards as basic shapes) pending further polish. The UI is minimal, with a basic on-screen control overlay and a simple beacon selection panel. On the AI side, a lightweight PPO reinforcement learning is intended to train bird behavior within each level, and a genetic evolution between levels should refine traits over generations
GitHub
. However, the ML implementation is only partly in place – current code stubs indicate that PPO and neuroevolution are not fully hooked up yet
GitHub
. Despite these rough edges, the core simulation (flocking, hazards, beacons, networking) is functional
GitHub
 and provides a solid foundation to build on. Key gameplay elements: “Blockers” in this context are the environmental hazards (e.g. tornadoes and predators) that can confuse or kill birds, forcing the player to plan routes carefully
GitHub
. “Beacons” are player-placed signals like food or shelter that attract or calm the flock, helping them navigate and recover energy
GitHub
. The balance between hazards and beacons is critical – hazards create challenges that must be countered by strategic beacon placement
GitHub
. The design goal is that hazards are dangerous but escapable, and beacons provide benefits (energy gain, stress relief, etc.) without trivializing the challenge
GitHub
. As birds survive multiple seasons, their AI should evolve – improving traits like hazard awareness or energy efficiency – making each new attempt slightly easier if they learn from past failures
GitHub
. The vision is an evolutionary sandbox: players observe and influence rather than directly control, and over time their flock “learns” to migrate more effectively. With this understanding, we can now address improvements in several areas: high-definition rendering, richer visuals/UI, better utilization of Phaser’s capabilities, refined game design for beacons and hazards, enhanced machine learning behavior, new feature ideas, and a first-time user experience tutorial.
High-Definition & Responsive Display Improvements
Currently, the game renders to a 1280×720 canvas regardless of the actual screen size
GitHub
. This fixed resolution can look letterboxed or pixelated on modern high-DPI displays. To provide a crisp, full-screen experience, several changes are recommended:
Adaptive Resolution Scaling: Leverage Phaser’s scaling configurations to match the canvas to the user’s screen or browser window. Instead of hardcoding 1280×720, use dynamic values (e.g. width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight) or Phaser’s Scale Manager. For example, using Phaser.Scale.FIT or Phaser.Scale.RESIZE mode with autoCenter: CENTER_BOTH will scale the game to fit any aspect ratio while preserving content
GitHub
. This ensures the 2000×1200 game world maps onto the display without excessive borders. The design documents explicitly target “multi-resolution support with aspect ratio preservation”
GitHub
, meaning the game should look good on anything from a mobile screen to a 4K monitor. Implementing this involves handling the browser resize event and updating the game’s size via this.scale.resize(width, height) if using Phaser 3, so that the canvas always uses as many pixels as available.
High-DPI (Retina) Rendering: Enable Phaser’s device pixel ratio support so that graphics are sharp on high-DPI screens. Phaser allows specifying a resolution parameter (e.g. resolution: window.devicePixelRatio) in the game config, which internally creates a higher-resolution canvas and then scales it down in CSS for crispness. By setting the resolution to 2 (or the actual device pixel ratio), the game will render with twice the pixel density, eliminating blurriness on Retina displays
phaser.discourse.group
. Care must be taken with asset sizes, but since much of the graphics are procedural or vector-based at the moment, high-DPI rendering will mainly improve text and shape clarity.
Full-Screen Option: Provide a way for players to toggle full-screen mode. Phaser has built-in support for fullscreen API; adding a simple button or key (e.g. press F for fullscreen) can immerse players completely. This pairs well with the adaptive scaling above. In fullscreen, the game can show more of the world or simply a larger view; if needed the camera can zoom accordingly. Ensuring the camera bounds are the world size (which is already set to 2000×1200 units
GitHub
GitHub
) means even on large screens the flock won’t fly off-screen.
Maintain Aspect Ratio or Dynamic FOV: The world’s aspect (2000×1200 ~ 1.67:1) is close to 16:9. On much wider or taller displays, using FIT mode will letterbox to avoid distortion, while RESIZE mode could show more of the world vertically or horizontally. We should decide which experience is better. Likely, preserving aspect ratio (letterboxing) is fine for now to keep consistent gameplay space. Alternatively, one could allow a slightly larger field of view on ultrawide screens to advantage those users. Either way, thorough testing on different resolutions is needed so UI elements (like the beacon panel and text) remain accessible and not stretched or cut off.
By implementing these changes, Murmuration’s display will become high-definition and responsive, filling the screen with sharp visuals. This is a foundational improvement that ensures all the visual polish we add later will actually be appreciated in full detail. It aligns with the project’s performance target of supporting modern displays while still hitting 60 FPS with large flocks
GitHub
GitHub
.
Maximizing Phaser Engine Capabilities (Performance & Effects)
To make the best of Phaser, we should utilize both its performance-oriented features and its rich rendering abilities. The current implementation is functional but could be optimized and enhanced substantially:
Sprite and Object Management: With potentially hundreds of agents and multiple hazards/beacons, it’s crucial to optimize rendering. Implement object pooling for agents and particles so that we recycle Phaser objects instead of constantly destroying/creating them each frame. The development notes indicate that pooling can reduce garbage collection significantly (by ~60% in tests)
GitHub
. We can maintain a pool of bird sprites and just activate/deactivate them as birds spawn or die. Similarly, use pooled particle emitters for effects like trails or explosions. This prevents frame drops when flocks are large (>200 birds), addressing known performance issues
GitHub
.
Culling and Level of Detail: Exploit Phaser’s camera culling – only render objects within the viewport. For example, if the camera is zoomed in on part of the world, sprites far off-screen need not be drawn. We can use the camera’s cull or manually toggle visibility for agents outside the view. Additionally, a Level of Detail (LOD) approach can be applied: birds far away (or when zoomed out) could be rendered as smaller or simpler shapes (or even not at all if beyond a distance threshold), while nearby birds get full detail. The visual showcase suggests implementing LOD yielded ~25% performance gains
GitHub
. In practice, this might mean turning off motion trail effects or using a single combined sprite for a distant flock cluster to reduce draw calls.
Batching Draw Calls: Group similar objects into Phaser Groups or Containers to allow WebGL batching. For instance, all bird sprites could share a single texture/atlas (once we use real sprites), enabling them to be drawn in one batch. Right now, using many individual Graphics circles may be forcing separate draw calls. Switching to sprite textures for birds and hazards (with perhaps a single spritesheet) will let Phaser batch draw them faster. The target is to keep draw calls under ~50 per frame
GitHub
. Using a container for the flock might also simplify transforming or scaling the whole group if needed (though likely the camera handles scaling).
Physics and Ticking: The game uses a custom simulation in Python for movement logic, but the client still updates positions every frame for rendering. Since we’re using Phaser’s Arcade physics engine (initialized but perhaps not heavily used for agent movement)
GitHub
, we should ensure that heavy computation stays in Python and the client only handles lightweight interpolation. If any physics or overlap checks are done on the client (e.g. for clicks), keep them minimal. We can also throttle certain updates – for example, UI text or debug info might not need to update every single tick if performance is tight.
Camera System Enhancements: Phaser’s camera control is already partially in use (arrow keys/WASD to pan, wheel to zoom)
GitHub
. We can add more “intelligent” camera behavior. For example, a flock-follow mode where the camera automatically centers on the flock’s centroid or their lead bird. This could be toggled by pressing space (as a “lock camera on flock” feature). The design goal is a smooth camera that can follow the action without constant manual input
GitHub
. We can implement predictive smoothing so the camera moves in anticipation of the flock’s direction (perhaps by looking at the average velocity of birds). Also, adding camera bounds (already set to world size
GitHub
 ensures the camera doesn’t show empty space beyond the world). Another nice touch is a “frame flock” function (shortcut key e.g. F) that zooms/positions the camera to fit all alive birds in view
GitHub
. This leverages Phaser’s camera zoom and pan with tweening for a cinematic feel.
Particle Effects & Shaders: Phaser 3 has a powerful particles plugin and supports custom shaders. We should use these to enhance visual feedback:
For example, give tornado hazards a swirling debris particle effect, with particles rotating around the center to simulate a vortex. The design docs explicitly mention “realistic spiral animations” and “particle debris fields” for tornadoes
GitHub
. We can spawn small debris sprites (dust or leaves) that spin faster as they get closer to the tornado center, conveying the hazard’s intensity.
Predators could have a subtle shadow or motion blur effect: e.g. use a shader to draw a semi-transparent shadow below a hawk sprite to show it flying above the flock
GitHub
. Also, when a predator is actively chasing, trigger a particle trail or speed lines behind it to emphasize its attack.
Motion trails for the birds themselves would make the flock movement more visually pleasing
GitHub
. We can attach a very short-lived particle emitter to birds that emits tiny faded dots or lines, creating a slight trail effect as they move. With 100+ birds, we must be careful to keep this lightweight – perhaps only birds with high cohesion or the front of the flock produce visible trails, or we use a single emitter that randomly emits from a few bird positions each frame. The idea is a faint streaking effect, not a heavy exhaust.
Overlays and visualizations: Phaser can draw vector graphics or shaders full-screen for things like wind maps or heatmaps. We could implement toggleable overlays (controlled by UI buttons) that visualize the wind field as moving arrows or the risk map as a colored heatmap over the terrain
GitHub
GitHub
. This might be done by drawing a grid of line segments or using a custom shader that draws arrows based on a noise texture for wind. It’s an advanced feature, but even a simple version (like a few arrows indicating wind direction in certain zones) can help players understand the environment. Since overlays could clutter the view, they should be optional toggles (and probably off by default in early levels).
Audio Utilization: While mainly visual, making the best of Phaser also means using its audio capabilities (Web Audio API). The game already has an AudioManager and mentions procedural ambient sounds
GitHub
GitHub
. We can extend this by adding 3D positional audio for certain events – e.g. hear a gusting wind sound when a tornado spawns (panned relative to its position), or predator screeches from the direction of the attack. Phaser can handle positional audio if we update listener location to the camera. Also, implementing the dynamic music idea from the design: use Phaser’s sound to layer music tracks. As cohesion increases, fade in a harmonic music layer; when birds die or panic, play dissonant tones or percussive effects
GitHub
. These audio cues greatly enhance the feel of the game and make the simulation more immersive.
In summary, leveraging Phaser’s full capabilities means optimizing performance (through pooling, culling, LOD) and enriching the audiovisual effects (particles, camera work, audio). The project’s documentation already envisions many of these: for example, “tornado systems with spiral animations and particle debris”, “animated predator sprites with pursuit effects”, and “environmental overlays (wind, risk, heatmap)”
GitHub
GitHub
. By systematically implementing these features, we’ll not only hit the target of 60 FPS with large flocks
GitHub
, but also make the world of Murmuration come alive in a way that maximizes what the Phaser engine can do.
Visual Look-and-Feel Enhancements (Graphics & UI)
Improving the look and feel of Murmuration involves upgrading both the in-game visuals and the user interface, to transform the current minimalist prototype into a polished experience. Key recommendations include:
Agent (Bird) Visuals: Replace the simple white circles with more evocative representations. The design vision is for birds to appear as “luminous glyphs” that stand out against the background
GitHub
. We could use small bird-shaped sprites or even abstract shapes (triangles or boids) with a glow effect. For instance, a sprite with a glowing outline or a trail can give the impression of a fluttering bird without requiring high-detail textures (which would be too tiny to see anyway). We should maintain the useful color-coding that’s already implemented – birds currently change color based on energy (green healthy, red low energy, etc.
GitHub
). This is great for feedback and should remain. We can integrate it by tinting the bird sprites or their glow. Additionally, implementing motion trails as mentioned earlier will enhance their perceived speed and group movement coherence. A subtle scale/pulse animation on each wing flap could be simulated if we want to indicate flapping; otherwise a steady gliding motion is fine. Overall, the flock should be visually mesmerizing – think of how a real murmuration (starling flock) looks like a swirling, sparkling cloud. Particles and smooth interpolation will help achieve this
GitHub
.
Hazard Visuals: Currently hazards are drawn as plain circles or rings (e.g. a red circle for predator radius, two concentric rings for tornado)
GitHub
. We can redesign the hazard graphics to be more distinctive and informative:
Tornado/Storm: Depict it with a rotating spiral sprite or an animated cone. We can use a sprite sheet or spin a graphic via code. Add debris as mentioned, and possibly a funnel cloud image in the center. Color can indicate severity: perhaps orange outer winds and a red core. The idea of graduated danger zones (outer/middle/inner rings) is already partly shown by drawing two radii
GitHub
 – we can enhance that by using different transparency or a gradient fill from the outside to the core (fading from transparent on the edges to a solid center). This immediately tells the player that getting closer to the center is more dangerous
GitHub
.
Predator: Instead of a plain dark red disk, use an animated sprite for the predator (e.g. an eagle or hawk silhouette). It could glide in circles when not attacking and dive when it targets the flock. The predator’s effective range can still be indicated with a translucent circle on the ground (to show “if birds enter this radius, predator will strike”). We can also add a “panic” visual effect when a predator attacks: e.g. affected birds flash or a brief red ripple emanates to show the panic spreading. This ties into feedback – players should see when a blocker is impacting the flock.
Other Hazards: As more hazard types are added (e.g. light pollution zones, if implemented), ensure each has a unique color and iconography. A static obstacle (like a mountain or building) might simply be an image on the map. Dangerous zones could be shown as red-tinted fog or a pulsating outline
GitHub
. Consistency and clarity are key: blockers should look threatening (using warm colors like reds/oranges, jagged shapes or motion), whereas beacons (the helpful signals) should look inviting (greens/blues, pulsating gentle glow).
Beacon Visuals: The beacons are a core interactive element for the player, so they should be visually appealing and easy to distinguish. Currently, Food, Shelter, Thermal beacons use either placeholder icons or colored circles
GitHub
GitHub
. We should introduce proper iconography for each beacon type:
Food beacon: perhaps a small food icon (a grain bundle or bread – indeed a “bread” icon asset exists
GitHub
). It could emanate a greenish aura since green is used for energy.
Shelter beacon: maybe a tent or house icon, with a calming blue aura.
Thermal (updraft) beacon: maybe a red upward arrow or sun icon, indicating lift/heat.
Future beacon types (as per design doc) like Light or Sound beacons would have their own icons (a lightbulb or musical note) with appropriate colored glows.
Each beacon on the map can be drawn as an icon with a pulsing ring around it to show its range of influence
GitHub
. This is already partly done (they draw a circle with stroke and animate its alpha)
GitHub
, which is good. We can improve it by showing a decay timer on the beacon: for example, a fading ring or shrinking pie-slice that indicates how much time is left before the beacon expires (since beacons have limited duration in the design). The docs suggest “decay animation arcs showing beacon strength over time”
GitHub
 – we could implement this by gradually reducing the radius opacity or drawing a circular progress bar around the icon. When a beacon is about to expire, maybe the icon blinks or the color dims to warn the player. All these cues enhance the feel that these are dynamic, temporary signals the player must use wisely.
Environmental Aesthetics: The game background and environment can be made more visually rich without distracting from the birds. Right now, a solid sky-blue background is used
GitHub
, possibly with a gradient or cloud sprite loaded but not sure if displayed. We should incorporate a sky gradient background that shifts color for day/night cycles. For example, a gradient from pale blue at the horizon to darker blue upward for daytime, shifting to oranges/purples at dusk, and dark navy with stars at night. The design plan calls for “night/day palette shifts”
GitHub
, which we can achieve by changing background color over time (since one game day = 100 seconds in sim
GitHub
, the sky color can interpolate accordingly). We can also add cloud layers: since some cloud assets exist, put them on a layer that moves slowly to simulate wind. Parallax effect (clouds moving slower than the foreground objects) can give depth. If the map has terrain (like coastlines or mountains), we might include subtle drawings or an underlay image for each level’s map. However, too much detail on the ground could confuse the player, so perhaps stick to abstract indications (like a darker area for a forest, white patches for snowy regions, etc., if relevant to a level). The focus should remain on the flock and interactive elements.
User Interface & HUD: The UI needs to evolve from the current text overlays to a clearer HUD:
Implement a top status bar showing crucial information: e.g. the current Day/Time in the season (e.g. “Day 3, 14:00h”), the remaining time in the level (if any), and perhaps quick stats like number of birds alive vs lost. A wind indicator or simple weather icon can be shown here to hint at conditions
GitHub
. For example, if a storm is forecast, an icon could appear.
The beacon selection panel can be improved in appearance and usability. Instead of small text buttons, use bigger buttons with the beacon icons and a number indicating how many are left or their cost. Since budget is limited (e.g. “Beacon Budget: 5” is shown in info text currently), the panel could visually show the remaining budget or uses per beacon type. After placing a beacon, that type’s button might gray out if no budget remains. Also add a “cancel/deselect” button so the player can easily stop placing a beacon if they change their mind (the current text says use a clear selection option
GitHub
, so we should have a UI element for that).
The right-side panel (telemetry) mentioned in the design doc can be gradually introduced. Initially, maybe just show Population (alive/total), Arrivals (how many reached destination), and Losses so far. This lets the player track progress at a glance without parsing text. As features like cohesion and diversity become relevant, add small gauges or bars for those. For example, a cohesion meter that fills up to indicate how tightly the flock is flying
GitHub
.
Overlays toggles and controls: At the bottom or a corner, have buttons or hotkeys for toggling overlays (wind, risk, etc.) and game speed (pause/1x/2x). The code already maps keys like - and = to slow down/speed up
GitHub
. A small UI element showing current speed or a pause icon when paused would be user-friendly.
Minimap: Though possibly a later feature, a small minimap could show an overview of the level, the flock as a dot, and the goal location. This is useful if the level is larger than the viewport. It can also reveal areas as the flock explores (implementing a fog-of-war that clears, as design suggests
GitHub
).
Styling: Adopt a consistent visual style for UI elements – likely a clean, minimal design with transparency so as not to block the game view. The current usage of semi-transparent black backgrounds with colored text (green titles) is a good start
GitHub
. We can refine fonts and colors (perhaps use a crisp, modern sans-serif font for readability). Ensure UI scales with resolution or is anchored so it remains appropriately sized on larger screens (Phaser’s setScrollFactor(0) and fixed positions help with that
GitHub
GitHub
).
Feedback & Polish: Little visual/audio feedbacks make the game feel responsive. For example, when you place a beacon, there is already a placement sound and a confirmation log
GitHub
. We can elevate this: play a distinct sound per beacon type (food beacon might have a gentle “chime”, thermal a windy whoosh). Also, flash the beacon icon or briefly enlarge it when placed to draw the eye. When a hazard kills some birds, we could show tiny “feathers” particle puffs or a brief skull icon near the event – something to acknowledge the loss without being overly graphic. When the flock reaches the destination (roost), perhaps a celebratory sound or a visual halo at the goal would reward the player.
Collectively, these improvements aim for a “clean, minimal, data-viz inspired” aesthetic with soft gradients and luminous effects
GitHub
. By enhancing sprites, animations, and the interface, we make the game not only more beautiful but also easier to understand at a glance. The player should be able to appreciate the flock’s beauty, identify beacons and hazards instantly, and monitor key stats – all contributing to a satisfying look and feel that complements the underlying simulation.
Optimizing the Design of Blockers (Hazards) and Beacons
Reworking the design of blockers and beacons means ensuring these game elements have clear, balanced roles and impactful interactions in gameplay. Here we focus on game mechanics and balance tweaks (as opposed to visuals) to maximize their effectiveness:
Distinct Hazard Behaviors & Counterplay: Each hazard (blocker) type should pose a unique challenge that requires the player to respond strategically:
Tornadoes/Storms: These might disorient the flock (causing random veering) and can kill a portion of birds caught in the core
GitHub
. To make gameplay fair, give the player some telegraphing – e.g., a storm might appear on the map with a warning icon or a forecast indicator a few seconds before it fully impacts, allowing the player a chance to guide birds away. The counterplay for storms could be planning a route around high-risk areas or using a Thermal beacon to quickly push the flock out of a storm’s path (since Thermal gives a forward boost
GitHub
). Ensuring storms have gradients of danger (outer area causes stress, inner area can kill
GitHub
) allows skilled players to survive a close brush if they react quickly.
Predators: Predators target stragglers or dive into the flock causing panic events
GitHub
. The design currently gives them a 20% kill chance on contact and induces panic in nearby birds. To refine this: maybe a predator will single out the weakest or furthest bird; if the flock is very cohesive (tight), predators have less success. This ties into an implicit counter: keeping high cohesion (via Sound beacons or just good flock management) reduces predator effectiveness. We could also allow a direct counter – e.g., an “Emergency Pulse” (already implemented as a server-side ability
GitHub
GitHub
, triggered with key 'E') might scare off predators or momentarily boost bird evasion. Emphasize such interactions so players feel they have tools to mitigate predator attacks beyond just hoping the AI learns. A possible addition is a cooldown indicator for these emergency actions so players know when they can be used.
Other Hazards: If present, e.g. “light pollution traps” (mentioned in later levels
GitHub
) – these might lure birds off-course at night. The counter could be using Light beacons of your own to out-attract the false lights or avoiding flying at night by reaching roosts before dark. Wind hazards (strong headwinds) can act as blockers by slowing the flock in certain map areas; the counter is using Wind Lure beacons to get a tailwind boost
GitHub
 or detouring around the worst area. The general principle is: for every blocker, the player should have a corresponding strategy or beacon to counter or mitigate it, but using those consumes limited resources (beacon budget or time).
Beacon Roles and Balance: We currently have Food, Shelter, Thermal beacons implemented. The design doc also envisions Light and Sound beacons as additional types
GitHub
. It’s important each beacon type feels useful and not redundant:
Food Beacon: restores energy and attracts birds to a location (e.g. a feeding area)
GitHub
. In the simulation, ensure that placing a food beacon actually increases birds’ energy if they fly near it (the backend should give an energy boost or slower energy drain in that radius). Balance: if food beacons are too powerful, players could just spam them; so maybe limit their number or make them costly (the design suggests cost 2 vs others cost 1
GitHub
). Also, once placed, a food beacon could deplete (no more food) after a certain time, preventing infinite energy.
Shelter Beacon: reduces stress and slows birds down (simulating a resting or calming effect)
GitHub
. This is useful if the flock is panicking or needs to regroup. We should make sure the game’s stress mechanic is noticeable – e.g., after a predator attack, birds could have elevated stress which makes them fly less cohesively; a timely shelter beacon would lower that, visible by birds changing color from red back to normal if we color-code stress. For balance, shelter might also have a limited duration (half-life ~1 day as design says
GitHub
) and a radius such that it can’t cover the whole flock if they are widely scattered (encouraging players to keep flocks tight).
Thermal Beacon: gives a forward boost and some energy gain
GitHub
. It essentially helps the flock cover distance faster – good for beating time limits or escaping hazards. We must ensure that using a thermal beacon at the wrong time (e.g., boosting into a storm) can be dangerous, so players use it judiciously. Possibly limit these more strictly (e.g., only 1 or 2 per level).
Light Beacon (future): attracts birds especially at night, used to guide them in darkness. Its role might overlap with food in attracting, but without energy benefit – more like a signal to draw them along a path. Useful in night levels or to divert from dangerous areas by outshining a hazard. Should be ineffective in daytime (so as not to be a catch-all).
Sound Beacon (future): increases cohesion in the area
GitHub
 – effectively telling birds “gather here” or follow the group. This could be used mid-route to tighten formation before entering a predator zone, for example. It’s a subtle effect, so to show impact, perhaps birds in range get a cohesion boost (fly closer together and align better). We’d need to implement that in AI – e.g., temporarily increase the weight of alignment behavior in boids algorithm when within the sound beacon radius.
Balancing beacons involves their cost and duration. The game design mentions a beacon budget per level and half-life durations
GitHub
. We should enforce that: after a beacon’s duration expires, remove it (and maybe leave behind a small marker or ghost to indicate it was used up). Players then must decide when and where to deploy limited beacons for maximum effect. A well-balanced beacon system means no single beacon type can solve every problem – players should ideally use a combination. For instance, a possible strategy: place a Food beacon early to build energy, use a Sound beacon to tighten formation, then a Thermal to push through a risky area quickly, and maybe a Shelter near the end to recover before the final leg. If one type is underused in playtesting, adjust its effect or cost to make it more appealing.
Interactions Between Beacons and Hazards: We can add depth by having beacons also interact with hazards:
Perhaps a Beacon vs Hazard interaction: e.g., maybe predators avoid Thermal beacons (heat or noise might deter them briefly), or a Shelter beacon could partially shield from storm effects (if birds are “resting” they duck the storm). These aren’t in the original design, but exploring them could add interesting emergent tactics. We must be careful not to make hazards trivial to negate, however.
Hazards could also affect beacons: for example, a tornado passing over a beacon might destroy it prematurely, or high winds reduce the effective range of a beacon (sound doesn’t carry far in a storm). These details, if communicated clearly, can make the world feel more interconnected. They could be introduced in advanced levels for additional challenge.
Difficulty Progression and Tuning: To optimize impact, ensure that early levels introduce these blockers and beacons gradually. The first world levels have “gentle wind; few predators”
GitHub
 – meaning hazards are light, giving players a chance to learn beacons without being overwhelmed. Later worlds add more hazards simultaneously. We should periodically review if any particular hazard is too punishing (instant fails are mentioned: e.g., certain levels fail if too many birds die in protected zones
GitHub
). Those should be tuned so that a player loses due to a clear mistake or lack of planning, not random chance. For instance, if a predator spawns directly in the flock with no warning, that would feel unfair – better to spawn it a small distance away so players see it coming on the screen or minimap and can react. Using the deterministic random seeding
GitHub
 helps ensure consistency; the same level attempt will have hazards behave predictably so the player can learn patterns.
In summary, blockers and beacons form a strategic push-and-pull. By sharpening each hazard’s behavior and providing the right beacon tools to counter them, we make gameplay engaging and skill-based. The guiding principle from the design playbook is that “hazards must be escapable but challenging, and energy drain is balanced by beacon restoration”
GitHub
. Our adjustments should uphold that: every blocker can be overcome by wise use of beacons and good flock management, but only if the player observes and times their interventions well. This creates tension and satisfaction in gameplay – the player is essentially shepherding a flock through perils, with beacons as their shepherd’s tools and hazards as the wolves.
Enhancing Machine Learning for Evolving Flock Behavior
One of Murmuration’s most innovative aspects is the idea that the flock learns and evolves over multiple runs. Currently, the groundwork for this is laid (a PPO-lite reinforcement learning loop and a between-level evolution step), but it needs to be fully realized and possibly reworked for effectiveness. Here’s how we can improve the ML-driven behavior so that the flocks truly evolve:
Complete the PPO Implementation: The game uses a simplified PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm to train the bird policy within a season
GitHub
. We need to ensure that this training actually occurs and impacts the birds. This involves:
Collecting experience data as the simulation runs (states, actions, rewards) for the flock’s policy network.
Performing periodic training updates. For example, every few seconds (or every X ticks), run a PPO update epoch in a background thread so as not to freeze the game. The code outlines parameters (lr=3e-4, batch=1024, etc.)

GitHub
 which we should use.
Important: make sure this training doesn’t slow down the frame rate. If real-time training is too slow, an alternative is to do training between seasons: simulate one season, collect data, then pause the game for a brief “training” phase before the next season starts (show a “evolving…” progress bar perhaps). Given the short length of a season (a few in-game days), doing training at the end might suffice and be more manageable.
We should monitor that the policy is actually improving. Logging metrics such as cumulative reward, or the TrainingMetrics provided in the code
GitHub
GitHub
, will show if the policy loss and reward are trending in the right direction. If after a few seasons there’s no improvement (birds still behave randomly or crash into hazards as often), we’ll need to adjust the reward structure or algorithm hyperparameters.
Reward Shaping and Objectives: The reward function greatly influences what the AI learns. The design doc provides a detailed reward breakdown: a continuous per-tick reward combining energy, cohesion, risk avoidance, and direct path efficiency, plus event rewards for reaching the goal, deaths, finding food, etc.
GitHub
. We must implement this reward function in the simulation and verify it aligns with desired behaviors:
For instance, +0.4 weight on cohesion means the AI gets rewarded for sticking together
GitHub
. This should encourage birds to not scatter. We’ll see that in gameplay as birds maintaining formations better over generations.
A penalty for detour distance encourages them to head toward the goal. If we find the AI is taking weird long routes to grab food (because perhaps energy reward is too high), we might tune down the food reward or increase the detour cost.
Negative reward for risk will teach them to avoid hazard zones. This is crucial – the agent’s observation should include whether it’s in a hazard’s radius, and the reward should drop when it is. Over time, the policy should learn to steer away from red zones.
We might need to adjust the magnitude of these rewards so that the learning is stable. For example, a death might give a big negative reward (e.g. -8 as per design
GitHub
). If deaths are rare events, that’s okay, but if a lot of birds die at once, the gradient might be huge. PPO can handle it via clipping, but we should watch for reward normalization.
Neuroevolution Between Seasons: The game proposes that between seasons (or between level attempts), the best performing birds pass on their “genes” (policy parameters) with slight mutations
GitHub
. Implementing this can drastically improve the flock across generations:
A simple approach: after each full level (or each season if allowed multiple tries), take the birds (or their policies) that survived with the highest fitness (e.g. those that made it to the end or had highest cumulative reward) and use them as “parents” for the next generation. This could mean averaging their neural network weights or selecting one to clone, then adding small random perturbations (mutations) to create variation. Replace the birds that died or performed poorly with these new offspring.
Alternatively, use an Evolution Strategies approach: treat the entire flock’s policy as one genome and do a population update. However, since we actually have many birds, a genetic algorithm on individuals might make sense – each bird’s “genome” could be the weights of its policy network (or an ID referencing a shared policy). In practice, if all birds share one neural network (which might be the case for simplicity), then we don’t have individual differences to evolve; instead we’d be evolving one policy over time via gradient descent (PPO) plus occasional mutation. If that’s the design, then neuroevolution might refer to running several separate simulations in parallel with slight policy variations and picking the best (an expensive approach).
For now, a reasonable compromise: use the PPO-updated policy at the end of a level as the baseline for the next level, but introduce some random initialization variance for exploration. This could be done by the PBT (Population-Based Training) idea mentioned – e.g., randomly adjust learning rate or exploration parameters between levels
GitHub
.
It’s important to persist the learned traits (save them). If a player beats a level with a well-evolved flock, the next level’s starting birds should carry those trait improvements. We can serialize the policy or trait values to JSON and load them next level
GitHub
. This gives the player a sense of progress (their birds are getting “smarter”).
Visible Evolution & Trait Feedback: To make the flock’s evolution meaningful to the player, surface some of the traits and improvements in the UI:
For example, if hazard_awareness is a trait that improves, we could show a stat in a debrief screen: “Hazard Awareness: improved to 0.7” or “Birds now react to danger 0.5 seconds faster than last generation.” This ties the AI’s progress to something the player can recognize.
We could implement a DNA/traits overview where the five evolvable traits listed (hazard awareness, energy efficiency, flock cohesion, beacon sensitivity, stress resilience
GitHub
) are displayed with bars or stars. After each level, increase some bars based on performance. For instance, if many birds survived a predator-heavy level, increase hazard awareness trait. This system doesn’t necessarily affect the actual neural network directly (which is more complex), but it can be a simplified representation (perhaps derived from the network or from performance metrics) that signals improvement.
Also consider an adaptive difficulty tied to evolution: if the flock gets very good (say the player earned 3 stars easily), the next contract might scale up difficulty (the design suggests increasing challenge if the player over-performs
GitHub
). Conversely, if the flock is struggling, perhaps allow an easier spawn pattern next try or give a slight buff. This ensures the ML doesn’t make the game too easy or too hard unexpectedly.
Experimentation and Tuning: ML in games often requires experimentation. We should be prepared to tweak:
Network size or complexity (the current policy is a small MLP with 64x2 hidden layers
GitHub
, which should be fine).
Exploration rate (if birds are too timid or too erratic, adjust how much random noise is in their actions).
Training frequency – too frequent might cause instability; too infrequent and they won’t learn within a level’s timespan.
If PPO proves tricky in real-time, we could switch to a simpler supervised learning or scripted behavior to ensure the birds at least do something reasonable, then gradually reintroduce learning. But given the scope, it’s worth pushing on the intended ML approach as it’s a major feature.
With a robust ML implementation, players will notice that each retry becomes a bit smarter. Initially, the flock might fly straight into a hazard and die. After a couple of attempts, the flock (if some survived or the simulation retained knowledge) will start avoiding that hazard, or sticking closer to beacons. This gives the game a compelling progression outside of the player’s direct skill – you’re effectively training your flock over time. It realizes the promise that “breeds evolve based on performance each level”
GitHub
. We must just be sure to communicate this to the player (through UI as mentioned) and ensure the evolution doesn’t overshoot (becoming overpowered) due to no caps – the design notes caution to cap evolution improvements to avoid god-mode birds
GitHub
. Following those guidelines, the ML-powered flock evolution can become a standout feature that keeps players engaged as they nurture and witness a smarter flock with each migration.
Five Ideas to Enrich Gameplay
Beyond the core improvements, here are five “killer” feature ideas that could make Murmuration even more engaging and replayable:
Asymmetric Predator Mode (PvP or AI Director): Introduce a game mode where a second player (or an advanced AI) controls the hazards, especially predators. For example, one player guides the flock as usual, and another player spawns and directs a hawk trying to disrupt the flock. This creates a tense predator-vs-flock scenario. If PvP is too complex, an “AI Director” could take control of a super-predator that intelligently adapts to the flock’s tactics, essentially becoming a boss fight. This idea adds competitive and unpredictable elements – no two playthroughs would be the same if a human or adaptive AI is orchestrating the challenges. It leverages the flock’s learning too: the predator might evolve counter-strategies, creating an evolutionary arms race that’s exciting to watch.
Flock Customization and Meta-Progression: Allow players to influence the evolution outside of pure performance. For instance, introduce “DNA points” earned from completing levels that the player can spend to tweak their flock’s traits before the next run. Maybe you want a breed that’s extra fast (boost speed at cost of higher energy burn) or very hardy against stress. Players could also customize the appearance of their flock – e.g., choose a color or a symbol for their bird species – creating attachment. Naming the flock or the lead bird could personalize the journey. This meta-game of breeding a custom strain of bird adds a layer of long-term goal setting. Over a 20-level campaign, a player might feel like they bred a champion lineage by the end. It also encourages replay: one could try a different trait build in a new campaign to see how it fares.
Dynamic Weather and Seasonal Events: Make each playthrough unique by adding random dynamic events on top of fixed levels. For example, even in a known level layout, you could have a chance of a “Great Storm” event on day 3 that wasn’t always there, or an unexpected early winter cold snap that forces the flock to land briefly. These would be signaled to the player (so it’s not unfair) but require adapting on the fly. Another idea is global seasonal changes: say the campaign is set over a year, and between levels you get a news that an El Niño year is occurring, meaning stronger winds and more storms in the upcoming levels. This adds variety and a storytelling element to the otherwise fixed progression. Technically, this can be done by having some procedural generation of hazard patterns or intensity each run (bounded by the level’s design). The key is to avoid monotony and give a bit of rogue-lite flavor – even if you replay the same level, the challenges won’t be identical.
Cinematic Replay & Highlight System: After successfully (or unsuccessfully) completing a level, the game could generate a replay or highlight reel of the flock’s journey. This might show a time-lapse of the flight path on the map, or key moments like “Here the flock almost collapsed cohesion” or “Predator attack at this point, 5 birds lost”. Implementing a replay might involve recording game state history (positions and events) during play. The payoff is huge in terms of player engagement: it allows players to relive epic moments, analyze their strategy, and share these replays with others. Imagine a player posting a video of their flock narrowly dodging three tornadoes and still making it – it’s great marketing and community content. We could also include a photo mode or slow-motion during replays for dramatic effect. This feature doesn’t directly affect gameplay mechanics, but it greatly enhances the experience and encourages mastery (players might replay levels aiming for a perfect run to record).
Online Cooperative Challenges and Community Content: Expand the game’s social dimension by introducing co-op or community events. In co-op, two players could collaboratively guide one large flock – perhaps each has a limited set of beacon types (one handles food and shelter, the other thermal and light), requiring coordination. This mode fosters teamwork and could be a lot of fun with voice chat, as players essentially become two “flock guardians” working in tandem. On the community side, think about seasonal challenges where a special contract level is posted weekly and players compete for best performance (least losses, fastest time, etc.). Leaderboards could rank the top migrations, and because of the replay system, players could watch the top replays to learn strategies. We could also allow players to design custom levels (with an editor to place obstacles and set parameters) and share them via the Steam Workshop or a code – creating user-generated content to extend the game’s life. While these features are non-trivial, they significantly boost engagement. A cooperative mode appeals to those who like to play with friends, and community challenges tap into competitive and creative energies of the player base.
Each of these ideas can make the game more interesting and replayable in different ways – PvP adds competitive drama, customization invests players in progression, dynamic events keep content fresh, replays let players revel in their story, and community features build a loyal fanbase. They could be introduced over time; for instance, start with the replay feature (self-contained and offline), then add flock customization in an update, and later experiment with a multiplayer mode. Together, these “killer ideas” could elevate Murmuration from a solid single-player experience to a rich platform of flock-based gameplay that players talk about and return to regularly.
First-Time User Experience (FTUE) Tutorial
To onboard new players smoothly, we should design a simple interactive tutorial as the first experience. The goal is to teach core mechanics (camera control, beacon placement, hazard avoidance, goal of game) in a guided, low-pressure environment. Here’s a step-by-step outline for an effective FTUE tutorial:
Introduction & Objective: The tutorial begins with a short narrative prompt – for example, “Welcome Warden! Your tiny flock is about to begin its first migration. Your job is to guide them safely using signals.” Display a clear objective: “Help at least 50 birds reach the roost (destination)!” – so the player knows what success looks like. Keep text brief and in-world if possible (could be a researcher guiding you via comms).
Basic Camera Controls: Before any action, prompt the player to practice looking around. For instance: “Use W/A/S/D or arrow keys to move the camera and scroll to zoom.” Highlight this on screen. Maybe an arrow points to the keyboard icon or the text overlay. Ensure the game world has something to see – e.g., the flock at the starting position and the destination marker somewhere in view or off to one side. Once the player pans/zooms (we can detect input), acknowledge it: “Good! You can always adjust your view to track the flock.”
Understanding the Flock: Show the flock of birds taking off. Pause their movement briefly and use an overlay or pointer to identify them: “This is your flock (the glowing green dots). They will try to fly towards their destination on their own, but they need your guidance to survive.” You might indicate the destination with a green circle far away
GitHub
. Possibly flash the destination icon and show a dotted line as the crow flies. This gives context that the birds have a goal but the player’s role is to help them get there efficiently and safely.
Placing a Beacon (Primary Mechanic): Now introduce beacons. For example: “Your flock is getting hungry. Place a Food Beacon to guide them to a feeding spot and restore energy.” Highlight the beacon panel (perhaps it starts highlighted or a big arrow points to the Food beacon button). Instruct: “Click the Food beacon button, then click on the map to place it.” The area to click could be indicated by a subtle glow – e.g., we want them to place it a bit ahead of the flock’s path. Once the player does this, immediately show the effect: birds turn towards it, the beacon icon appears with its radius. A text might pop up: “Great! See how the birds head for the Food beacon 
GitHub
. They’ll regain energy when they reach it.” You could even show an energy bar icon rising for the birds in range to reinforce the point.
Hazard Encounter and Response: Next, create a scenario with a hazard to teach avoidance. Perhaps as the flock moves on after eating, spawn a small predator ahead. The tutorial message: “Oh no, a predator (hawk) is nearby, ready to attack!” Highlight the predator icon in red. “Predators will chase and scatter your birds. Let’s avoid it by steering the flock.” In this controlled tutorial, we can either let the player use a beacon to avoid or introduce the Shelter beacon as a counter. For example: “Place a Shelter Beacon on the left side to draw your flock away from the predator and give them a rest.” The player does so, flock veers toward shelter, hopefully missing the predator. If some birds still get caught, that’s okay as a lesson – we can script the predator to only scare but not kill too many in the tutorial. Once accomplished: “Well done. The shelter beacon calmed the flock and helped them evade the predator!” This teaches that beacons aren’t just for direct benefits but also for pathing.
Reaching the Destination: Now the roost (goal) is in sight. Highlight it (maybe a glowing green zone at the edge of the map). “There’s the roost where your birds will rest. Guide them there to finish the migration.” If the flock isn’t already heading that way, prompt use of a Thermal beacon: “Place a Thermal Beacon pointing toward the roost to give them a boost home.” The player places it, birds get a speed lift and head in that direction. Alternatively, if no beacon is needed, just let them fly. As the birds enter the destination, celebrate: “Congratulations! The surviving birds have reached safety.” Perhaps display how many made it (e.g., “55/60 birds survived”).
Summary & Next Steps: Show a brief debrief screen (even if simplified for tutorial): “You helped X birds complete the journey. Losses: Y.” And then highlight how birds will improve: “Your flock learns from each trip – next time, they’ll be a bit wiser!” Finally, prompt the player to start the real campaign: “Now you’re ready to take on the first migration contract. Good luck!”
Throughout the tutorial, use visual cues like arrows, highlights, and pausing the game at key moments so the player isn’t overwhelmed in real time. The tutorial level itself should be very forgiving: gentle wind, maybe one mild hazard, and unlimited beacon use or generous budget so the player can experiment. In fact, the first campaign level (W1-1 “First Flight”) is described as gentle
GitHub
, which suggests it doubles as an introduction. However, an explicit tutorial where the game tells the player what to do step by step, as outlined above, can prevent confusion. Make sure to cover all fundamental actions: moving the camera, placing each beacon type (at least the ones unlocked initially), recognizing hazards, and understanding the goal. Also mention the pause button (spacebar) so players know they can pause to think – this is important for newcomers. Possibly incorporate that: “Press Space to pause if you need time to plan.” By the end of the FTUE, the player should feel comfortable with controls and tactics: they’ve placed beacons, avoided a hazard, and succeeded in guiding the flock. This sets them up to tackle the campaign with confidence, and they’ll have the tutorial as a reference in their memory (some games even allow replaying the tutorial or having “tooltips” on early levels reminding these lessons). A well-crafted FTUE ensures players don’t bounce off due to confusion, and it aligns with the design pillar of “Readable complexity: clear overlays expose the system”
GitHub
. We used overlays and clear instructions to make the complex simulation readable from the start.
By implementing all the above recommendations – high-definition adaptive rendering, Phaser-powered performance optimizations, visual/UI polish, balanced game mechanics for blockers/beacons, robust machine learning evolution, creative new features, and a friendly tutorial – Murmuration will significantly elevate its quality and player appeal. These changes will make the game not only technically sound and beautiful to look at, but also deeper and more accessible. Each improvement feeds into the next: a better display lets players appreciate the visuals; improved visuals and UI make it easier to grasp mechanics; well-tuned mechanics combined with evolving AI create engaging gameplay; and novel features along with a good tutorial ensure players stay excited and onboard. This comprehensive plan provides a roadmap for the development team (and their AI agents) to implement changes in manageable stages, ultimately fulfilling the ambitious vision set out in the design documents

now make some clear UI/UX recommendations to bring this game visuals to the next level. this is the same game. here in the picture you can see clear UI superposition issues etc. you can check the github repo if it helps. Make the recommendations technical and clear and not simple. 
ChatGPT said:
Here are technical UI/UX recommendations to bring Murmuration’s visuals to the next level, based on your screenshot and repo setup:

1. Resolve Overlay and Superposition Issues
Use Phaser’s Scene layering: Split UI and gameplay into separate scenes (UIScene and GameScene) and render UI with higher z-index so telemetry, controls, and beacons never overlap unpredictably.

Anchor panels to viewport: Use setScrollFactor(0) and this.scale.on('resize', ...) to ensure telemetry boxes, controls, and overlays stay pinned in consistent corners regardless of camera pan/zoom.

Avoid duplicate UI: Right now you have both a floating “Controls” box bottom-left and a “Murmuration Controls” box top-right. Consolidate into one panel (or make the bottom-left context-sensitive, only appearing on tutorial levels).

2. HUD Redesign
Telemetry Left Panel: Instead of floating blocks that overlap (Flock Telemetry, Breed Evolution), combine them into a single HUD card with tabs or collapsible sections.

Example: A “Flock Stats” card showing cohesion, speed, stress, energy, with progress bars for each.

Place “Breed Evolution” as a post-level debrief screen instead of cluttering gameplay.

Controls Right Panel: Make collapsible (toggle with H hotkey). Default collapsed after tutorial. Keeps gameplay screen clean.

Beacons Panel: Dock horizontally at the bottom with large icon buttons (Food, Shelter, Thermal). Add usage counter overlay (e.g., “x3” left). On hover, show tooltip (cost, effect, duration).

Destination Marker: Add a permanent mini-panel top-center showing target distance left, % of flock alive, and current day/time.

3. Improve Beacon & Hazard Visualization
Beacons:

Replace plain text “Food / Shelter / Energy” with icons (SVG or PNG sprite atlas).

Show decay arc animation: a radial progress indicator around each beacon, shrinking as its effect expires.

Pulse/glow the icon subtly every few seconds to signal activity.

Hazards (Blockers):

Replace concentric circles with gradient-filled rings (outer yellow transparent → inner red opaque) to visualize severity.

Add particle fields (dust swirl for tornado, black feather bursts when predator strikes).

Add subtle animated danger icon above hazard (⚠️ symbol scaling in/out) for clarity when zoomed out.

4. Camera & Scaling
Dynamic scaling: Set resolution: window.devicePixelRatio in Phaser config and scale: { mode: Phaser.Scale.FIT, autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH }.

Camera modes: Keep manual pan/zoom, but add:

Auto-follow mode: camera centers on flock centroid.

Frame flock (V): tweens camera zoom to fit all birds.

Mini-map: small top-right overlay with flock, hazards, and beacons.

5. Typography & Readability
Replace small monospace debug fonts with Phaser BitmapText or webfonts (e.g. Inter / Roboto).

Use color coding: green = positive (energy, safe), red = danger (hazards, losses), yellow/orange = warnings.

Apply semi-transparent panel backgrounds (rgba(0,0,0,0.5)) with rounded corners for modern HUD style.

6. Interaction UX
Beacon placement flow:

On selecting a beacon type, cursor changes to beacon icon.

On hover, preview its range circle before clicking.

Right-click cancels placement (in addition to “Clear Selection”).

Feedback:

On beacon placement: small “pop” animation + distinct sound per beacon type.

On hazard kill: tiny feather particle burst + flock health bar pulse.

7. Technical Implementation Checklist
 Create UIScene separate from GameScene.

 Use Phaser.GameObjects.Container for grouping related UI (telemetry, beacon panel).

 Switch hazards from Graphics.strokeCircle to Phaser.GameObjects.Arc with gradient fills and alpha tweening.

 Implement beacon decay via Phaser.Time.Clock and arc mask animation.

 Refactor duplicated controls into one collapsible panel (Phaser.DOMElement or Phaser UI plugin).

 Use responsive scaling: update UI sizes on resize event.

⚡ These steps make the HUD professional, readable, and non-overlapping, while making beacons/blockers feel alive and intuitive.

Do you want me to mock up a redesigned UI wireframe in code (Phaser scene with HUD placeholders) so your team can drop it into the repo as a starting point?

 i want to change the core principle of the gameplay. here is my vision. we influence a flock of birds going from A to Z, with intermediary steps B C D etc. One migration is A to Z. One level is A to B, B to C etc. The basic idea is that you need to reach your destination with as many birds as possible. It doesn' thave to be litterally A to Z, the first migrations could be simple, like A to B . and so on. The main parameter is fatigue. Birds need to take breaks and get their energy back, otherwise it depletes. We need an energy gauge that depletes based on distance (not time) and is not sufficient to go in a straight line. This is why you need to put beacons to steer the birds. The food should be placed in the levels by design, not by the user. The goal of the user is to steer the birds so that they find the food, recharge, and then leave again to their destination. If only 10% of the energy remains, birds start to die. I want each bird in the flock to have slightly different abilities: endurance, obstacle detection range, and leadership "(ability to attract others), and speed. Speed is only use when trying to escape predators. Predators can sustain a certain speed for some time then slow down. So some birds can survive. Between 2 levels, surviving birds recharge their endurance. But the other parameters don't change. We should start with 50 males, 50 females. And there should be persistance in the tracking of the flock between levels, and migration (unless the user chooses to restart a new game). Then we need obstacles: storms first. The storms trigger an avoidance mechanism when they are detected. Birds go in random directions to avoid them, possibly attracting others based on their leadership. But when they are in the storm space, their energy depletes faster (reasonably, but variably depending on the storm). The storms can be moving slowly. Then we can have predators: predators should be moving slowly and chasing birds one by one if you encounter them and killing them. When a migration is complete, the surviving birds make babies, exactly one per couple (so 2 females can't make a baby), and a new baby of a new generation takes the best genes of its mom and dad across each characteristic. Special birds who have led the flock at least 10% of the time get an increase in their leadership skill by 5%. Birds who have survived storms or predators increase their obstacle detection range by 5%. Birds who have survived predators increase their speed by 5%. Let's start with this, absorb this, put it in a very detailed design document, and based on the current project code base, explain the various changes that need to happen in details in the form of a detailed roadmap. 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks, that’s a rich and clear vision. Before I generate the full design doc and implementation roadmap, could you confirm a few details to ensure alignment:

Should I completely replace the current gameplay loop (user-placed beacons, energy/stress) or retain parts of it where possible?

For food placement — do you want it fixed per level (level designer manually defines coordinates), or procedurally generated but consistent?

Should I assume you're keeping the current ML infrastructure for flock learning/evolution, or replacing it with a genetics-based inheritance only?

Should the level structure (A→B, B→C, etc.) be a linear fixed campaign or procedurally chained levels?

Do you want the roadmap to include UI/UX changes (e.g., per-bird stats, visible energy bars, persistent flock tracker) as part of the deliverables?

Once I have this, I’ll provide a precise and exhaustive design + implementation breakdown.

You said:
1/ we can replace, but we need to keep the peaceful, top down view of birds flying in flocks. 2/ let's try procedurally generated, consistent, but with clear rules so that the levels are not too easy or too hard. 3/ replacing with genetics 4/ partially procedural. We want each migration to get a bit harder, but within each, levels can have simple rules for procedural generation and progressive difficulty. 5/ i want nice stats, and the ability to click on each bird, different colours per genre, a way to differentiate generations, and a nice end of migration panel to show the results of the new generation, and how the new flock looks like
ChatGPT said:
Got it. I’ll generate a comprehensive design document and roadmap for your updated vision of Murmuration. This will include:

A revised gameplay loop with endurance-based flock migration (A→Z), procedural level design, and food placement rules.

A genetics-based trait inheritance and progression system for persistent birds.

Technical implementation details for stat tracking, procedural hazards (storms, predators), and a UI/UX redesign including bird selection, gender/trait visibility, and generational progress displays.

A step-by-step migration-level progression structure and end-of-migration results panel.

I'll align this with the current Murmuration codebase to identify precise refactors, new systems, and files impacted.

Design Overhaul and Roadmap for Genetics-Based Murmuration

Murmuration Gameplay Overhaul – Design & Implementation Roadmap
Overview of New Core Gameplay
Murmuration is transforming from a sandbox of flocking birds into a multi-stage migratory survival game. The new core loop centers on guiding a flock through a long migration broken into segments, managing fatigue and hazards, and evolving the flock’s traits over generations. Players will influence (not directly control) the birds by placing beacons/signals, preserving the peaceful top-down flock view, while the birds make their own decisions
GitHub
. Success is measured by how many birds reach the final destination of a migration. After each full migration, survivors breed to produce a new generation with inherited traits, making each subsequent migration more resilient. This document details the new gameplay design and the required changes to the current codebase, including energy/fatigue mechanics, level structure, bird attributes, hazards, genetic evolution, procedural difficulty, and UI improvements.
Migration Structure and Level Flow
Multi-Leg Journey: Each migration consists of a series of level segments from a starting point “A” to the final destination “Z”, with intermediate checkpoints “B”, “C”, “D”, etc. Each level is one leg of the journey (e.g. A→B, then B→C, and so on). A full migration (A to Z) might span several such legs. This replaces the previous single-level “contract” model
GitHub
. The flock persists across these legs – birds that survive one level will carry on to the next with their state and stats intact (except for energy, which is refilled at each stop). The game will track the flock continuously through the migration unless the player starts a new game. Checkpoints as Rest Stops: The end of each level (e.g. point B, C, etc.) serves as a safe roost or feeding ground where birds can rest and fully recharge their energy before the next leg. This ensures continuity: surviving birds start each new segment fresh in terms of energy (endurance) but retain any other impacts (e.g. injuries, trait improvements). If the flock reaches the final destination “Z” of the migration, that migration is considered complete and a breeding phase is triggered (described later). Level Completion Goals: The primary goal each level is simply to get as many birds as possible from the start to the end point. Unlike the previous design which had specific targets (arrivals, cohesion, time, etc.)
GitHub
, the focus here is on maximizing survival. However, we may still enforce a minimum survival requirement to progress (for example, at least one bird must reach the next checkpoint). Time is less of a strict “limit” now and more a contributor to fatigue (distance traveled matters more, see Energy mechanics below). The player does not necessarily “fail” a level if many birds die – they will just have fewer birds continuing – but if all birds die (extinction), the migration fails and the game ends (or the player must restart that migration). Persisting State Between Levels: We will utilize the existing genetic simulation structure to carry birds forward. The GeneticSimulation class already supports keeping a dictionary of all birds and resetting their positions for a new level without resetting the population
GitHub
GitHub
. After each leg, we will invoke a function (similar to reset_level()) that:
Replenishes each survivor’s energy to full (endurance recharge).
Resets birds’ position to the next leg’s start (which will be the previous leg’s end coordinates).
Removes any birds that died in the level from the active population.
Optionally, records survival stats (e.g. increment survived_levels on BirdEntity
GitHub
 to track experience).
This ensures continuity of the flock from A all the way to Z. The codebase’s current GameSimulation spawns fresh agents per level
GitHub
; we will replace that with the persistent approach in GeneticSimulation which keeps survivors in self.birds and simply repositions them for the new segment
GitHub
.
Energy and Fatigue Mechanics
Energy Gauge: Each bird has an energy/endurance meter (0 to 100) representing its fatigue level
GitHub
GitHub
. Flying consumes energy, and birds must rest or eat to replenish it. Crucially, energy depletes based on distance traveled, not just time. In the current simulation, energy decrement is a flat per-tick value
GitHub
, which is time-based. We will modify this to be proportional to the bird’s movement distance or speed. For example, instead of subtracting a constant 0.05 each tick, we could subtract an amount scaled by the bird’s velocity (so flying faster or covering more ground drains energy faster). This change ensures that taking longer, winding paths (greater distance) costs more energy, encouraging efficient routing. Fatigue and Death: If a bird’s energy falls too low, it faces exhaustion. Specifically, when only ~10% of energy remains, the bird is in critical condition. The game will communicate this visually (e.g. bird icon flashing red) and mechanically – if a bird stays below 10 energy for too long, it will collapse and die from exhaustion. (Internally, this could be implemented by increasing the base energy drain when energy < 10, or simply by the bird’s energy hitting 0 shortly thereafter, as currently any bird hitting 0 energy is marked dead
GitHub
.) The code already includes a helper Agent.is_exhausted() that returns true below 10 energy
GitHub
; we will leverage that to trigger a death if a bird remains in exhausted state (e.g. for more than a few seconds of simulation time). In essence, 0% = death, but reaching 10% is effectively a point of no return if no food is immediately found. Rest and Refueling: Birds can recharge energy by stopping at food sources (see next section on Food). The level design will ensure that a straight-line flight from start to finish is not possible on one full tank – birds must detour to feed at least once to make it. For instance, if a level’s distance requires ~120 energy to traverse, but birds only have 100 max, there will be a feeding spot partway. When birds reach a feeding area, their energy will replenish (we may instantly refill to 100, or simulate a slower regain). In code, we can repurpose the existing logic for “food beacons” which currently restore energy gradually when within radius
GitHub
. However, instead of a player-placed beacon, these food sources are static level elements (discussed below). We will likely increase the refill rate compared to the current +0.5 per tick
GitHub
 so that birds can recover fully during a short stop. Energy Carry-Over: Between levels (at major checkpoints), all surviving birds get their energy fully restored (they have effectively rested at the checkpoint). Thus every new leg starts with the flock at full endurance. This simplifies gameplay and emphasizes planning within each leg independently – the challenge is making it to the next stop. The code will handle this by resetting agent.energy = 100 for all survivors at level transition (similar to how reset_level in genetic sim resets energy based on longevity
GitHub
, which typically results in full or near-full energy for each bird).
Individual Bird Attributes and Diversity
Each bird in the flock is no longer identical; they have unique abilities and stats that influence their behavior and survivability. We introduce (or emphasize) the following key attributes for each bird:
Endurance – How far a bird can travel on a full energy tank. Mechanically, this might tie to energy efficiency: birds with higher endurance deplete energy more slowly
GitHub
GitHub
. In the code’s genetic traits, this corresponds to the energy_efficiency trait
GitHub
 (or possibly longevity as a hidden trait for fatigue resistance
GitHub
). A high-endurance bird can fly longer without resting.
Obstacle Detection Range – How early the bird perceives storms or predators (hazards). This aligns with the hazard_awareness trait
GitHub
. Birds with better awareness will start evading a storm or predator sooner, meaning they may divert around it rather than blundering into danger. In implementation, this could factor into the hazard avoidance logic: currently any bird within a hazard radius is affected
GitHub
; we could scale the effective radius or “danger_factor” based on the bird’s awareness (e.g. a bird with high awareness might treat the hazard as if it were larger – thus responding earlier and escaping with less impact).
Leadership (Attraction Ability) – A measure of a bird’s natural influence on the flock. Birds with high leadership tend to fly at the front or center of formations and attract others to follow them. In gameplay, if a “leader” veers away (say to avoid a storm or head toward food), other birds are more likely to copy that movement, improving group cohesion. We will likely add a new trait for this (e.g. leadership or reuse flock_cohesion trait in a new way). Implementation might involve weighting the cohesion/alignment behavior: currently, each bird averages neighbors equally
GitHub
; we could weight neighbors with higher leadership more strongly, effectively letting leaders tug the flock’s direction. Another approach is designating a few birds with top leadership as “temporary focal points” that others treat almost like moving beacons.
Speed – This is the bird’s maximum flight speed (especially under stress). All birds cruise at roughly similar speeds normally, but speed comes into play during predator chases or emergency escapes. A bird with higher speed can outrun predators when sprinting. In code, we already have a speed_factor trait per bird
GitHub
. Additionally, the simulation caps bird speed based on energy (e.g. max speed 80 when energy > 50, else 60)
GitHub
. We might adjust this such that individual birds’ max speed = base max * their speed_factor, and allow temporary bursts when fleeing predators.
Other Traits: The existing code and design documents include a few additional traits like Stress Resilience (tolerance to fear)
GitHub
 and Beacon Sensitivity (how strongly they respond to player signals)
GitHub
. These will continue to play a role but were not explicitly mentioned by the new design prompt. We will retain them as part of the genetic makeup because they enhance the depth: e.g. stress resilience means a bird doesn’t panic as much in storms/predator attacks (less erratic fleeing), and beacon sensitivity means some birds might ignore player cues while others follow diligently. Keeping these aligns with the existing code (Agent has stress and beacon_response fields
GitHub
GitHub
).
Gender and Reproduction: We start each new game with 100 birds: 50 males and 50 females
GitHub
. Gender matters only for breeding (one male + one female required per offspring). During flight, male and female birds behave the same (except any visual differences). We will visually distinguish gender (e.g. blue tint for males, pink for females
GitHub
) so the player can see the composition of the flock. Gender balance becomes a strategic element – if too many of one gender die, breeding output will drop since unpaired survivors can’t reproduce. Stat Variability: All these traits vary slightly per bird. In generation 0 (the starting flock), traits will be randomly distributed in a reasonable range
GitHub
. For example, one bird might have 60% hazard awareness, another 45%, etc. Visual indicators like size could reflect some traits (the existing design mentions size variation
GitHub
, which is implemented as size_factor affecting sprite scale). The differences are subtle but meaningful – some birds will naturally excel at long distance (high endurance), others at guiding the flock (leadership), etc. This creates emergent gameplay where, for instance, a very aware bird might dodge a storm early and survive where others die, or a fast bird might be the sole escapee from a falcon attack.
Environmental Obstacles: Storms and Predators
The migratory journey is fraught with dangers that the player must help the flock navigate. We focus on two main obstacle types: storms and predators. (Other hazard types from the original design like wind fields or light pollution traps can be integrated later, but storms and predators are the key in this design.) Storms: Storms are turbulent weather zones that the birds should avoid or quickly pass through. When birds detect a storm ahead, they will attempt to avoid it by veering off course, even if it means temporarily scattering the flock. In gameplay terms, when a bird comes within a storm’s radius, it triggers an avoidance response: birds do not just continue straight; they randomly alter direction to get out of the storm area. This can break flock cohesion as each bird might take a slightly different evasive path (we simulate “panic” or confusion in the storm). In the code, we will use the hazard handling loop to implement this: currently, for storm hazards the sim applies a push force and increases stress
GitHub
. We’ll augment that by adding a random lateral component to velocity or by temporarily reducing the cohesion/alignment forces within the storm, causing birds to spread out chaotically. While inside a storm, energy drains faster. This is already implemented: being in a storm hazard applies a massive energy loss up to 3.0 units per tick
GitHub
GitHub
, on top of normal fatigue. We will retain and calibrate this. The idea is that flying through a storm is extremely taxing – a bird’s stamina will plummet, meaning if they don’t exit quickly, they could die of exhaustion mid-storm. If a storm is particularly severe, there’s even a chance of instant death events (like lightning strikes); the current code simulates this with a small random chance of a bird being struck and killed
GitHub
. We can keep such rare events to heighten the tension. Storms in a level can be moving (e.g. drifting slowly across the map) or static. A moving storm makes the avoidance more dynamic – e.g. a storm front might sweep across the birds’ intended path, and the flock needs to detour around it. We will specify movement vectors for storms in level data (the code already sets a direction on storm hazards
GitHub
). The simulation can update the storm’s center each tick by its velocity. We need to implement moving hazard positions over time (currently hazards are mostly stationary fields; we might create a small update in each simulation step to shift storm coordinates by hazard['direction'] * speed). This ensures storms are not trivial stationary obstacles and can catch the flock if not planned around. Predators: Predators (e.g. hawks or falcons) are singular threats that chase and attack the birds. In a level, a predator might appear in a certain zone or randomly along the route. When the flock comes near a predator, the predator will single out birds and pursue them. The key dynamic is a chase of limited duration: a predator can fly fast to catch prey, but only for a short sprint (predators have their own stamina). If a bird can evade that initial burst – for example, by outmaneuvering or outlasting the predator’s sprint – the predator will tire and give up, letting the bird survive. In practical terms, when birds enter a predator’s range, some will get caught and killed, but not all – usually the slower or weaker ones. The current simulation logic for predator hazards already does the following: it pushes birds away (simulating an escape maneuver)
GitHub
, increases their stress (panic)
GitHub
, and has a random chance to kill birds that get very close (within 50 units)
GitHub
. There’s also the concept of an “alpha” predator with instant kill chance if extremely close
GitHub
. We will build on this by incorporating the predator pursuit time. We can introduce a timer or state in the predator hazard: e.g. once a bird comes within range, mark that predator as “engaged” for, say, 5 seconds during which it can kill birds (via the random checks each tick). After 5 seconds, we assume the predator gets tired or loses the flock and stops killing new birds (maybe it flies off or perches). This means if the flock can keep fleeing (or the player can use a distraction beacon, etc.) and avoid that predator for a short time, any surviving birds after that window are safe from that particular predator. Essentially the predator hazard might “deactivate” or greatly reduce its danger factor after its active phase. We could implement this by giving predator hazards a chase_timer. Each simulation tick, if the predator has detected the flock (birds in range), decrement the timer and apply the usual effects. Once timer hits zero, set hazard['danger'] to a much lower value or remove the hazard. This models the predator slowing down. Additionally, we might allow the fastest birds to survive: since our birds have varying speed traits, those with higher speed_factor will be more likely to outrun the predator’s danger zone before getting caught. This is implicitly handled by the random kill chance scaled by distance and “danger” value
GitHub
, but we can make it explicit: e.g., give predators a top speed value (maybe as part of hazard data), and if a bird’s speed exceeds that after some time, the bird escapes. The simulation already limits bird speed by energy
GitHub
 – perhaps during a predator chase, we override to allow birds to push toward their max potential (e.g., temporarily allow max_speed = 100 for those fleeing, using their speed_factor). This way, a bird with speed_factor 1.1 might outrun a predator of speed_factor ~1.0, whereas a slow bird gets caught. Multiple Predators and Frequency: As migrations progress, the number and aggressiveness of predators will increase (see Procedural Difficulty). Early levels might have a single predator encounter which is avoidable, whereas later ones might throw multiple predators in sequence or “gauntlets” (e.g., a level called Falcon Corridor originally
GitHub
). The system for predator hazards should support multiple predator entities each with their own positions and chase behaviors. We may reuse the sim.hazards.predators module (if any exists) or define predator hazard entries in level JSON with properties like position, danger, movement speed, etc. The code already spawns a default predator hazard with attributes like danger and speed
GitHub
. We will extend that: for example, danger could correlate with how lethal it is (chance to kill if in range), and speed might correlate with how fast it moves or how large the chase radius is. Summary: Storms encourage the player to route around or through quickly, at the cost of energy, while predators force momentary panic and culling of the flock, especially targeting the weak. Both obstacles are heavily influenced by bird traits:
Birds with high hazard awareness detect storms/predators earlier and start avoiding sooner, likely reducing losses
GitHub
.
Birds with high stress resilience handle the chaos better – e.g., they might not scatter as far in storms or recover quicker from predator panic.
Fast birds can escape predators; cohesive birds (or those following a leader) might stick together through a storm and reform faster after.
We will ensure these links exist in code (e.g., integrate hazard_detection trait by scaling the effective hazard radius, and stress_resilience by reducing added stress per tick
GitHub
 for those birds).
Player Beacons and Guidance Mechanics
The player’s role remains indirect control: you cannot steer birds individually, but you place signals (beacons) to influence their movement
GitHub
. The new design refines what the player can and cannot do:
Beacons Steer, Not Spawn Resources: In the prior prototype, players had beacon types including a “Food” beacon that could presumably create food sources, and maybe others like “Light” or “Sound”
GitHub
. We are removing the ability for players to create food on the fly – food is now part of level design, not a deployable. The player’s beacons will be used purely to attract or repel the flock in certain directions. For example, the player might place a Light Beacon to draw the flock toward a safe area or a Sound/Cohesion Beacon to tighten their formation. The exact beacon types available might be simplified, focusing on directional influence.
Guiding to Food: Since food/rest stops are fixed in each level, the player’s main challenge is to guide the flock to those stops. This can be done by placing a beacon near the location of the food to ensure the birds notice and go there. The flock’s natural foraging behavior plus beacon influence should lead them to it. For instance, if a food site is slightly off the direct line to the destination, the player should drop a beacon on or just beyond the food site so that birds veer toward it, refuel, then continue. In essence, the beacon system becomes a way to “steer” the flock’s path through waypoints the player deems important.
Limited Beacon Budget: We will maintain a limited number of beacons per level (e.g. 3-5) to prevent spamming
GitHub
. This means the player must place them strategically – likely at least one to guide to each food stop, and possibly one to avoid a hazard. Unused beacons might carry over if multiple seasons or attempts are allowed, but since our structure is deterministic segments, we can simply allow the player to pause at the planning stage of each level and allocate beacons anew (similar to the original “Planning (place pre-season signals)” step
GitHub
).
Beacon Effects: The types of beacons in the original design included Light (attract at night), Sound (increase cohesion), Food Scent (draw birds to food, consuming a stock), and Wind Lure
GitHub
. We will simplify to a few core ones:
Attraction Beacon – a general-purpose beacon (could be represented as a light or sound) that attracts nearby birds within a radius toward it
GitHub
. This is used to lead the flock to a point. (In code, this could use the existing mechanics of the light beacon or the food beacon minus the energy gain – essentially an attractive force).
Repellent or Avoidance Beacon – possibly a “distress call” or similar that could nudge birds away from a location (useful to divert them from a predator or storm). We might or might not include this depending on complexity; primarily, player will be guiding towards safe areas rather than explicitly steering away from danger (since often guiding toward an alternate route inherently avoids the danger).
We will remove the Food beacon from the player’s toolbox, since food is not player-spawned now. The Wind or Thermal beacon might not be needed either, as we aren’t emphasizing wind in this phase.
Beacon Half-Life: Beacons don’t last forever. They will remain active for a certain duration (e.g., a day or so in game time)
GitHub
. In practice, since each level is fairly short (perhaps a few minutes of real time), a beacon could simply last the entire level or most of it, fading as the flock nears the destination. We retain the concept that you can’t just drop infinite permanent signals – they decay, forcing timely placement.
Usage during Level: The player can drop beacons during the flight in real-time if needed (e.g., a predator appears from the bottom of the screen – the player might quickly place a beacon to one side to swerve the flock away). This interactive element keeps the player engaged in each segment, observing and reacting (“watch to win” design pillar
GitHub
). We will ensure the UI allows beacon placement and removal fluidly (the existing UI spec already has left panel for beacon slots and drag-and-drop placement
GitHub
 and click to remove).
Implementation in Code: The GameSimulation class currently tracks self.beacons and applies their effects each tick
GitHub
. We will:
Remove references to beacon type 'food' from the UI and prevent players from placing those. Instead, food sites are handled separately (see below).
Possibly remove or repurpose 'shelter' and 'thermal' beacon types
GitHub
 if they aren’t needed in new design. (Shelter was reducing stress and slowing birds, thermal gave energy boost; these were more specialized. We may drop them initially to focus on core mechanics).
Continue using 'light' or 'sound' beacon logic if present (not explicitly in the snippet but presumably similar) for attraction.
Pre-placed Food: At level initialization, spawn environmental food objects. One straightforward way: use the beacon mechanism but as an immovable beacon that the player didn’t place. For example, we could define in level JSON a list of food_sites with x,y and radius. The simulation can load these and internally treat them like a beacon that gives energy. In fact, leveraging the existing code: currently, a beacon of type 'food' adds energy to nearby birds
GitHub
 – we could spawn a beacon of type 'food' at each food site at start, but mark it as not counting against the budget and not removable by player. This way, as birds come into that radius, they automatically regain energy. We just need to ensure these beacons don’t expire too quickly (perhaps give them a very long half-life or simply refresh them each level).
Alternatively, we implement food sites as a new kind of stationary object and handle them in the simulation loop separately from beacons/hazards. For instance, after processing hazards, we can check if a bird is within a certain radius of a food site, then increase its energy. Either approach is fine; using beacon logic is quick since the effect is already coded (see if beacon['type'] == 'food': agent.energy = min(100, agent.energy+0.5)
GitHub
). We will just manage the creation of those beacons through level design rather than user input. In summary, the player’s job is to plan a route for each leg by placing a few beacons so that the flock will hit the necessary rest stops and dodge major hazards. They remain in an advisory role, influencing but not directing each bird. This keeps with the “influence > control” philosophy
GitHub
 and makes the game about strategy and observation rather than twitch reflexes.
Genetic Evolution Between Migrations
Once a migration (all its levels from A to Z) is completed, the game enters a breeding phase to create the next generation of birds for the subsequent migration (which will likely be more challenging). We preserve the idea that knowledge/traits carry over across runs
GitHub
, but in a biological sense rather than the previous ML policy sense. Here’s how it works: Survivors Breed: All birds that survived the entire migration (i.e. they are alive upon reaching point Z) will contribute to the gene pool. We will form breeding pairs from the survivors – specifically, one male and one female per pair (if there’s an odd bird out of one gender, that bird cannot reproduce). Each pair produces exactly one offspring
GitHub
. This offspring will form part of the next generation. Importantly, the parents themselves remain in the population into the next generation as long as they survived (we don’t assume they die after breeding, though we could impose an age limit if desired). So the new flock for the next migration will consist of all the survivors (the parents) plus all the new offspring. For example, if 40 birds (20♂, 20♀) survived, we can get up to 20 offspring, resulting in a new flock of ~60 birds. If a large portion survived (say 80 birds), we get 40 offspring (one per pair) making 120 total; in that case we might cap the population or have some birds “retire” – more on population management below. Inheritance of Traits: Offspring inherit their traits from their parents. Rather than a simple average, we will implement a “best of both” dominant gene selection with some randomness:
For each trait (endurance, detection, leadership, speed, etc.), the child tends to inherit the higher value from either mom or dad (i.e. the better of the two)
GitHub
. This realizes the idea of “taking the best genes of each parent.” However, to keep things from homogenizing too quickly, we add variability:
Sometimes (e.g. 30% chance) the child might get a blended middle value instead
GitHub
, or even the lower value if luck dictates, to maintain diversity.
We also introduce small mutations – a slight random ±5% to some traits
GitHub
 – ensuring that occasionally a trait can exceed both parents or introduce new variation (which is important for long-term genetic health).
Physical traits like size and base speed might blend more directly (e.g. child’s size is average of parents plus a small random tweak)
GitHub
.
Hidden traits like fertility and longevity can be treated similar to core traits or have their own inheritance logic (the current genetic system code has detailed logic for breeding that we can reuse
GitHub
GitHub
, but the conceptual summary stands: each trait is inherited with a bias toward the better parent’s value).
The end result is offspring that are often stronger than either parent in each respective trait (since they often take the max). Over generations, this yields a steadily improving flock – which is desirable as challenges increase. It’s essentially an accelerated natural selection: only survivors breed, and their best attributes get passed on. (This is slightly “Lamarckian” since we’re rewarding survivors by direct trait inheritance, but it serves gameplay.) Trait Boosts from Experience: In addition to genetic inheritance, we want to reward birds for heroic deeds within their lifetime. Special accomplishments by survivors will yield a direct stat increase (which can then be passed on genetically to their offspring as well):
Any bird that acted as a leader for a significant portion of the migration (e.g. flew at the front of the flock for at least 10% of the journey time) gains a +5% bonus to its Leadership trait. This could translate to, say, if its leadership trait was 0.5, it becomes 0.55. Mechanically, we will need to track which bird(s) are at the forefront over time. We can approximate “led 10% of the time” by tracking for each bird the number of ticks it was in the front 5 or 10% of the flock by horizontal position (since we know migration direction is generally eastward, the “front” is the one with largest x-coordinate). If a bird meets the threshold, mark it as a Flock Leader in the results.
Birds that survived a storm (entered a storm hazard and made it out alive) gain +5% to their Obstacle Detection (hazard awareness) trait, reflecting that they learned to anticipate such dangers better next time.
Birds that had close calls with predators (e.g. a predator was within a very short range but they escaped) gain +5% Speed. Or simpler: any bird that survived a predator encounter (was in a predator’s radius and didn’t die) gets the speed boost, since they likely had to sprint for their lives and improved their top speed.
These improvements can be applied directly to the bird’s Genetics attributes at end of level. For instance, if a BirdEntity has genetics.speed_factor, we multiply it by 1.05 for the qualifying birds. The code already tracks some of these events: BirdEntity.close_calls could be incremented for near misses
GitHub
, and we can use that as a trigger for a speed boost if close_calls > 0. Similarly, we might track a led_ticks count to determine leadership boost. Storm survival might be inferred from how much storm energy drain or stress the bird accumulated (or a boolean flag if it was ever in a storm zone).
Note that these trait boosts not only make the survivors themselves a bit better for the next migration (if they survive to participate again), but also raise the average genes they pass to offspring. This is a slight non-genetic improvement that we allow for gameplay fairness (rewarding the player for saving certain birds). It also creates emergent narratives, e.g. “Old Red has led the flock through three migrations and is now a seasoned veteran with high leadership.”
Next Generation Flock Composition: After breeding, we have a mix of survivors (the parents) and new offspring. We plan to keep the population roughly around 100 birds for manageability (this was the starting count and seems to work for performance and design). If a lot of birds survived and thus a lot of offspring were produced, the flock could grow too large – we will enforce a cap (for example, 100 max). The breeding system in code already contemplates capping and even “retiring” older generation birds
GitHub
GitHub
. Our approach:
If the total survivors + offspring > 100, we may remove the excess. Priority could be given to the youngest generation (because they likely have better genes). For instance, after creating offspring, sort all birds by their generation (newborns vs older survivors) and possibly by fitness, then keep the top 100
GitHub
. This mimics natural turnover – older birds eventually phase out.
Conversely, if very few birds survived (say only 10), we’ll still get 5 offspring, totaling 15. That’s below a healthy population. In that case, we might allow those pairs to have more than one offspring each to rebuild numbers. We saw a hint of this in the code: if survivors < 20, they let pairs produce 3 offspring each, etc.
GitHub
. We can adopt a simpler rule: ensure the new generation has at least ~50 birds (or some minimum for a viable flock). If not, allow multiple offspring per pair or even introduce some “immigrant” birds (a bit of random new blood) to bump it up. But ideally, through balancing, complete catastrophic losses are rare if the player plays reasonably.
After breeding, we label all offspring as Generation 1 (or increment generation count), and increment survivors’ generation index if we consider each migration a generational step. However, it might be more intuitive to keep the original birds as Gen0 until they die off, with offspring as Gen1, etc., which the code’s BirdEntity supports with a generation field
GitHub
. We will likely use the generation field to mark which migration a bird was born in. This helps in UI (differentiate generations visually) and possibly in culling old ones. Genetic Diversity and Mutation: One thing to monitor is genetic diversity – if only a few birds survive and breed, the gene pool can narrow (inbreeding). The original plan had a diversity metric
GitHub
GitHub
. We won’t delve deep into that here, but to avoid trivializing the game (where eventually all birds are clones of the single “super survivor”), our mutation factor and occasional random inheritance will maintain some variance. Also, we might include a rule that if the population gets too low, offspring get extra random mutation (to simulate a “bottleneck” recovery effect). The code does something akin to this by giving more offspring when population is critically low
GitHub
 and by always adding some new random birds if under a minimum
GitHub
. We will use those mechanisms to keep the flock genetically healthy and capable of adapting to new hazards. In summary, between migrations the game evolves. The new generation should on average have slightly better stats (higher endurance, awareness, etc.) than the previous generation, thanks to inheritance of the best traits. The game will get harder (next section), but the flock is also improving to meet the challenge. This creates a long-term progression where the player feels a sense of improvement not through unlocking abilities but through the birds themselves becoming stronger each run.
Procedural Level Generation and Difficulty Progression
We want each migration to be a bit harder than the last, and within a single migration, each subsequent leg can also be slightly more challenging than the previous, but not in a way that feels unfair or random. To achieve this, we’ll use procedural generation with controlled rules for level layout (hazard placement, distance length, etc.), ensuring a smooth difficulty curve. Distance and Number of Legs: Early migrations will be shorter (fewer legs from A to Z) and each leg is shorter in distance. For example, the first migration might just be A→B (a single short hop) serving as a tutorial. The next migration might be A→B→C (two legs), and so on, up to maybe 5 or 6 legs in a later migration. We can also simply treat each “World” in the original campaign as a migration – e.g. World 1 had 4 contracts, that could correspond to a migration of 4 legs
GitHub
. The total distance to cover in a migration increases gradually. The original level table provides distances (D column) going from 40 up to 180
GitHub
. We can use those as rough targets for final migrations in our new scheme. So Migration 1 might total ~40 distance (one leg), Migration 2 totals ~70-80 (two legs), ... Migration 5 totals ~180 (multiple legs). Each leg will be on the order of 40–60 distance units such that one food stop is needed per leg. We’ll generate the exact distance of each leg randomly within a range, making sure it’s not trivial (e.g. at least 30% of max endurance so that fatigue matters) and not impossible (within reach with one or two stops). Placing Food Sites: For each leg, we will procedurally place 1-2 food sources (depending on leg length). The placement should feel natural – e.g. a lake or field halfway through the route. We ensure that the direct distance from start to end exceeds 100% of bird endurance, forcing a detour. However, the distance from start to the food and then to end should be possible with two 60%+ segments. Essentially, the food acts as a bridge. If multiple foods are placed, they can be along alternate paths (giving the player some strategic choice of route). We may also adjust how much energy is restored by each food site; possibly later levels might have scarcer food so birds only refill to, say, 80% instead of 100%, requiring more careful chaining of stops (this is an advanced idea; initially we assume full refuel to keep it straightforward). Hazard Generation: The number and intensity of hazards (storms, predators) will increase with migrations:
Early Levels: Few hazards, maybe one mild storm or one predator, and largely avoidable. E.g. Migration 1 might have just a small storm off to the side that you can totally avoid by going around (teaching the concept).
Mid Game: Introduce multiple hazards. Perhaps one leg has a storm and a predator both, forcing the player to juggle avoidance (maybe take a longer path to avoid storm, which risks running low on energy if you miss the food stop, etc.). Storms might start to cover more of the direct path, requiring a larger detour or flying through with losses if unprepared. Predators might come in pairs or in sequence (e.g. one after the other, so the flock gets harassed twice).
Late Game: Hazards can combine and be more severe. Large storm systems that definitely engulf the path (the player must use the most aware birds or speed through at a cost). Predators that have higher danger (more lethal) or appear unexpectedly (perhaps random “predator bloom” events on a timer, as hinted by original design
GitHub
). Also possibly new hazard types like storms with lightning (already coded
GitHub
) or protected zones (areas the flock should not enter at all, akin to no-fly zones, though that might be beyond current scope).
Procedural rules: We won’t make hazards completely random; each level generation will follow rules to ensure fairness:
For each leg, define a hazard budget/difficulty score. Early legs get a low budget (maybe 1 minor hazard), later legs get higher. E.g., in code we might randomly choose hazards from a list until the budget is filled. A storm might cost X points, a predator Y points, etc.
Ensure at least one clear route remains: The algorithm should check that there is some viable path from start to finish that a clever player can find (with beacon help) where not all birds automatically die. This might involve spacing hazards or limiting overlapping ranges. It could be informal (level designer’s intuition if levels are semi-handcrafted or using seeded patterns).
Gradually ramp parameters: e.g. storm radius/strength grows in later worlds (like W4-4 had guaranteed storm line
GitHub
), predator danger increases. We can use world number (or migration index) to scale these. For instance, Storm strength (how fast it drains energy) might start at 2 and go up to 5 by final world; Predator danger (base kill chance) might start 0.3 and go to 0.6; Number of predators from 1 to maybe 3 in a level by the end.
We can leverage some of the existing level JSON format for hazards. The code references a levels.json from which hazards are loaded if present
GitHub
GitHub
. We will modify or generate those JSON entries procedurally at run-time or have templates. For example, a level config might look like:
"Level3": {
  "n_agents": 100,
  "start_zone": [200, 600, 100],
  "destination_zone": [1800, 600, 150],
  "hazards": [
     {"type": "storm", "x": 1000, "y": 500, "radius": 150, "strength": 12, "direction": [0, -1]}, 
     {"type": "predator", "x": 1400, "y": 550, "radius": 100, "danger": 0.4, "speed": 5.0}
  ],
  "food_sites": [
     {"x": 1200, "y": 400, "radius": 80}
  ]
}
In this hypothetical, the storm and predator are placed such that the direct line from start to end goes through them, but notice a food site is placed perhaps off-center (y=400) which might encourage the player to take a slightly different route. We’ll create such level data on the fly or via configuration files. Progressive Difficulty: Each new migration (generation) will start at a higher baseline difficulty. To formalize:
Migration 1 (Gen0 flock): Very forgiving. Short distance, one leg or two legs, minimal hazards, plenty of time to reach food.
Migration 2 (Gen1 flock): Increase distance and maybe add a second hazard or trick (like crosswinds or a predator).
...
Migration N: By the final migration, distance is long and multiple legs, hazards combine (e.g. you might go through a storm then immediately face a predator while low on energy – requiring expert play and a well-bred flock).
If we align loosely with the earlier 5-world idea
GitHub
GitHub
, we might have 5 migrations in a “campaign”. But since we have generational improvement, the game could potentially continue indefinitely (Endless mode), but the prompt seems to frame it within a campaign context. We can decide on a final migration that tests the ultimate “dynasty” of birds the player has bred. Level Variability: Even though levels are generated, they should remain consistent once generated (no randomization on retry) to ensure the player can learn from mistakes. We might seed the generator with the migration number so that each migration’s levels are deterministic for a given playthrough scenario. This also allows adjusting difficulty if needed (we can tweak generation rules in updates). Boids Behavior Tuning: With increased difficulty, we may need to adjust flocking behavior parameters to maintain game balance. For example, if hazards cause too much scattering, we might increase the birds’ natural tendency to regroup after (which could be done by raising cohesion weight outside of hazard zones). The original cohesion calculation is quite involved
GitHub
, but in simpler terms, we ensure that once out of danger, birds converge again so the player doesn’t have to herd stragglers individually. This keeps gameplay focused on macro signals rather than micromanaging. All these adjustments aim for progressive challenge: each migration pushes the player to use the improved traits of their flock and their own learned skills. By the time the player reaches the hardest migration, they should have a well-honed flock (through genetics) and a deep understanding of how to use beacons and read the environment – making victory feel like a true achievement.
User Interface and Bird Visualization
To support the new gameplay, the UI will present more information about individual birds and the flock’s status, without overwhelming the player. Key improvements include: Bird Statistics & Inspection: The player can click on any bird to view its individual stats and history. The UI will show a small panel for the selected bird with details such as: gender (♂/♀ symbol), generation (e.g. “G2”), key trait values (endurance, detection, leadership, speed, etc.), and maybe a record of how many migrations or hazards it survived. This feature is partly in place – the current game already allows clicking agents to view stats
GitHub
; we will extend that to include the new genetic traits. For example, if the bird has a hazard awareness of 0.65, we might display “Awareness: 65%” along with a brief description (“detects danger early”). This helps players identify which birds are their “all-stars” (e.g. a bird with very high leadership might be one they pay attention to during play). Color-Coding and Sprites: We will visually differentiate birds:
By Gender: As mentioned, males and females have tinted colors. For instance, male birds might have a blue hue, females orange/red (or any distinct palette that is colorblind-friendly). This was outlined in the genetics design
GitHub
. The rendering engine can apply a shader or colored sprite variation per bird (the Visual Showcase indicates breed differentiation and energy/stress color coding is already implemented
GitHub
GitHub
).
By Generation: We want players to recognize new birds vs old survivors. A simple approach is to adjust the color brightness or add a subtle outline based on generation. For example, Gen0 (original birds) have a neutral appearance, Gen1 (first offspring) might have slightly brighter or differently tinted feathers. Another idea is adding a tiny number label or icon on the bird (though with 100 birds that might clutter). Instead, perhaps the end-of-level summary will emphasize generation differences more than the real-time view. Still, we could provide a filter or highlight if the player wants to see, say, only Gen2 birds (this might be an advanced UI toggle).
Leadership Marker: Birds with exceptionally high leadership trait or those designated as leaders through gameplay could be marked with a small halo or distinct shape. For instance, the top 1-2 natural leaders might have a slightly larger glow, indicating other birds tend to follow them. This is subtle but can cue the player into which bird is likely at the forefront of decision-making in the flock’s movement.
Flock Statistics: We will introduce a stats panel (likely in a corner of the HUD) that shows aggregate information:
Current number of birds alive, maybe split by male/female.
A “fatigue meter” showing how many birds are in high fatigue (perhaps the percentage of flock below 20% energy).
Maybe a quick icon or number of how many birds have died this level (losses), to track the toll of hazards.
If feasible, average values of key traits in the flock (e.g. average endurance, average awareness). This might be more detail than needed during play, and could instead appear in the after-action report. But it could be nice to see, for example, “Avg Speed: 1.05×” and “Avg Awareness: 0.52” to know the overall capability of the flock.
The code’s SimulationServer already packages some telemetry for the client – e.g. it sends population, arrivals, losses, cohesion, etc. in each update message
GitHub
. We will extend this data structure to include generation counts or trait averages. The PopulationStats dataclass exists for such summary
GitHub
 and includes averages for traits and a diversity metric, which we can utilize to display in UI (perhaps under an expandable “Flock Stats” section). End-of-Migration Results Panel: After completing each migration (reaching point Z), a detailed results screen will show the outcome and set the stage for the next generation:
Survivors Count: How many birds (and how many of each gender) made it. Possibly list a few notable survivors by name/ID (if we have naming, or at least by trait like “Highest endurance bird survived with X% energy left”).
Losses: How many perished during this migration, maybe broken down by cause (e.g. 5 lost to storms, 3 to predators, 2 to exhaustion).
New Offspring: How many hatchlings were born. We can display something like “20 pairs bred, yielding 20 offspring (Gen2)”. If possible, show a quick summary of the offspring traits (maybe an average or highlight extremes: “Offspring inherited stronger endurance from parents, avg endurance +5% over last generation”).
Trait Changes: This is a critical part to illustrate the evolution. We can present a before vs after comparison of the flock’s genetic makeup. For instance, a small table or bar chart of average trait values in Gen1 vs Gen2, highlighting increases. If our PopulationStats computed avg_hazard_awareness etc., we use that to show improvement. E.g. “Awareness: 0.50 → 0.55 average (+0.05)” indicating the flock is more aware now. The Diversity index could also be shown to reassure the player that the gene pool is still varied (or warn if it’s not).
Bird Lineage Highlights: We might include a “Hall of Fame” callout – e.g. if a particular bird has now survived 3 migrations and led the flock twice, that could be noted (“Bird #27 (F) – veteran leader, +10% leadership over two migrations”). The GENETICS_SYSTEM notes ideas like a Hall of Fame and top bloodlines
GitHub
. We can implement a simplified version: maybe just list the top 3 birds by a fitness or contribution score, to create a narrative.
New Flock Preview: Show the composition of the new generation that will start the next migration. For example: “Next Generation: 60 birds (34 males, 26 females). Gen2: 20 new, Gen1: 40 surviving.” We can visually present the flock with color coding by generation (e.g. new offspring blinking or outlined). If feasible, an interactive family tree for a selected bird could be accessible (though that might be a stretch goal; the server does have a get_family_tree message handler
GitHub
, implying some support for lineage graphs).
This end-of-migration panel is crucial for player understanding. It celebrates the success (or failure) and prepares strategy for the future. Implementing it will mostly be on the client side (React UI), taking data from the simulation. We will ensure the server provides all needed info (list of survivors and their traits, list of offspring, etc., possibly via an extended SimulationResult or a final message type when migration ends). Miscellaneous UI:
The primary HUD will continue to show basic info like the day/time (if we keep a time-of-day system), a minimap with fog of war, and toggles for overlays (wind, risk, etc.) as per original design
GitHub
. We might not need the strike counter or protected area indicators from the old design, depending on if we include those fail conditions.
Controls remain the same: pause, speed control, beacon placement with mouse, etc. No direct control of birds will be introduced.
Accessibility: Different bird colors for gender should be chosen with colorblindness in mind (perhaps use symbols in UI as backup). The UI system from before already considered high-contrast modes
GitHub
 which we will maintain.
Overall, the UI should give the player clarity into the flock’s health and composition, enabling informed decisions (where to place beacons, which birds to safeguard). It also needs to provide feedback on why birds died (so the player learns to avoid that next time) and how the flock is improving (to motivate the meta-progression). With the above enhancements, the player will see their flock evolve visually and statistically from one migration to the next, fulfilling the “readable complexity” and “learning across runs” pillars
GitHub
.
Implementation Roadmap
To implement this overhaul, we will tackle it in stages. Below is a detailed roadmap linking the design elements to specific changes in the codebase and development tasks:
Game Mode Refactor – Persistent Flock and Multi-Level Flow:
Integrate GeneticSimulation as the core game loop: Transition from using GameSimulation (single level, disposable agents) to using GeneticSimulation (persistent agents with genetics) for the primary game mode. This involves initializing a GeneticSimulation for the campaign, which can run through multiple legs. We will use methods like reset_level() in GeneticSimulation to move to the next segment without wiping survivors
GitHub
GitHub
. Ensure that after each level, the simulation is not torn down; instead, call a reset to reposition birds and load new hazards.
Level sequencing: Implement logic to load the next level in sequence after completing one. Possibly maintain an index of current checkpoint (e.g., A->B is level1, B->C level2, etc.). Once final level of a migration is done, trigger the breeding phase (see step 5).
Data persistence: Ensure that important bird data (traits, survived_levels count, etc.) persists across level loads. The GeneticSimulation.birds dict will retain BirdEntity objects
GitHub
, so we must be careful not to re-init it each level. We may add a flag or separate mode in SimulationServer to indicate we’re in campaign mode so it doesn’t create a fresh simulation on each “load_level” message, but rather calls reset_level on the existing one.
Remove old victory conditions: The prior win conditions (target_arrivals, time_limit, strikes) in GameConfig
GitHub
 become less central. We will simplify: victory for a level is reaching the checkpoint (not all birds, just at least one). Remove or ignore target_arrivals and time limits – or set them generously so they don’t enforce failure arbitrarily. The only fail condition per level should be extinction of the flock (population < 1), which is already handled
GitHub
. We can drop the cohesion collapse or other fail states from campaign mode to focus on survival gameplay (those were more relevant to sandbox scoring).
Energy & Fatigue System Updates:
Distance-based energy drain: Modify the simulation step where energy is decremented each tick. In the current code, energy decays by a fixed 0.05 each tick
GitHub
. Change this to something like:
distance_traveled = np.linalg.norm(agent.velocity) * dt  
agent.energy = max(0, agent.energy - (distance_traveled * energy_decay_rate))
We’ll calibrate energy_decay_rate so that a bird flying at normal cruising speed will use roughly, say, 1–2 energy units per second (tuning needed). This ties usage to actual movement distance. Birds gliding slowly or circling will consume less, whereas a bird sprinting (high velocity) to escape a predator will burn energy faster.
Exhaustion death: Implement a check that if agent.is_exhausted()
GitHub
 returns true (energy < 10) for a sustained period, the bird dies. One approach: each tick that energy < 10, increment an exhaustion_time; if it exceeds some threshold (e.g. 5 seconds of game time), set agent.alive=False and log a death due to fatigue. Alternatively, we can simply rely on the fact that if no food is found, the continuing distance-based drain will reach 0 soon anyway, causing death as per existing code
GitHub
. The nuance is to possibly make <10 a critical zone that drains faster or is irreversible. We might not need a separate mechanic if distance-based drain naturally brings it to 0, but we’ll test and adjust.
Recharge at food: Implement automatic energy restoration when at a food site. The easiest way: treat food sites as beacons of type 'food'. We can update level loading to parse food_sites and for each, do something akin to:
self.beacons.append({ 'id': 'food'+str(i), 'type': 'food', 'x': fx, 'y': fy, 'radius': fradius, 'strength': 1.0 })
Using strength 1.0 and the existing beacon handling will give +0.5 energy per tick in radius
GitHub
. We may increase that strength or modify the beacon handling to give a bigger boost or even instant refill when at the exact food point. Another implementation: explicitly loop through food_sites in the simulation step and do energy += some value when in range. Either way, test that birds can refill from near-empty to full by staying at the food for a short while. We might also slow birds down or cause them to circle when at a food site (simulating landing/feeding). A simple way: when a bird is in food radius and energy < 100, zero out its velocity or reduce it significantly for a few seconds (to simulate roosting) – this could be done by, say, applying a brake or using the existing “shelter beacon” mechanic which slows birds
GitHub
. This prevents them from overshooting the food.
UI feedback: Update the energy UI bar (if any) or color coding to reflect the new mechanics. Possibly color the bird sprite red when below 10% energy (the Visual Showcase mentions red for low energy
GitHub
 which might already be done). Ensure the HUD displays something like “Exhaustion imminent!” if many birds are low on energy.
Beacon System Adjustments:
Remove Food Beacon from player UI: Update the beacon selection so the player cannot choose a food beacon (since food is environmental now). Likely in the React UI side, remove that icon/option. Also adjust beacon budget if needed (since one type removed, maybe budget stays same but now for other types).
Implement/retain useful beacons: Ensure the attraction beacon (light/sound) works. In code, a light beacon might not be explicitly coded, but we can reuse the 'food' type as a generic attractant by removing the energy gain portion. Alternatively, define a new beacon type 'attract' that just pulls birds with a certain strength (similar to how food beacon does minus the energy effect). We might reuse 'thermal' beacon's forward boost or scrap it.
Beacon effect balancing: Possibly increase the radius or strength of beacons to make them more influential, since guiding birds precisely to food or around hazards may need strong signals. The design doc listed beacon radii ~150-200
GitHub
. We can tweak those constants in code (search for usage of beacon['radius'] and beacon['strength']). For instance, ensure that if a beacon is placed slightly off the flock’s path, it reliably pulls them.
Beacon decay: Keep the concept of half-life, but ensure it’s communicated to player (e.g. a timer on the beacon icon). We may use the existing half-life values from design doc or adjust. Possibly not a priority for initial implementation – beacons could last whole level initially, for simplicity, then we refine if needed for difficulty.
Hazard avoidance vs Beacon: Make sure that the birds don’t blindly follow a beacon into a hazard. If a beacon’s attraction is too strong, birds might ignore their own hazard avoidance and go through a storm because the player said so. In an ideal implementation, birds weigh both – e.g., if a storm is directly on the path to the beacon, the birds’ AI should decide to detour anyway rather than suicide. This might require tuning weights: the flock’s steering algorithm (which sums migration force, beacon influence, and avoidance)
GitHub
GitHub
 should prioritize hazard avoidance (high danger) over beacon attraction. We can increase the effect of hazard forces or reduce beacon influence when energy is high risk. This is more of an AI tuning detail, but important for emergent behavior.
Bird Attributes Implementation:
Expand Genetics model: Our Genetics dataclass already covers hazard_awareness, energy_efficiency, etc. We will add leadership if not already present. The GENETICS_SYSTEM.md didn’t list leadership explicitly, and the current code doesn’t have a direct leadership trait. We can define leadership: float = 0.5 in Genetics. This will require:
Adding it to the Genetics class definition in simulation_genetic.py (similar format as other core traits) and include it in to_dict and random initialization (maybe random between 0.4–0.6 like others).
Also include it in breeding logic (most likely as part of a trait group – perhaps group it with social traits). If we treat leadership as separate, we can implement inheritance: child gets one parent’s leadership with mutation, or average, etc.
Add corresponding field in Agent or BirdEntity if needed. Perhaps an agent doesn’t need a direct field for leadership if it’s mostly used in flocking logic; we can access a bird’s Genetics via BirdEntity when computing influence. But for performance, maybe we mirror it on Agent as we did with hazard_detection and beacon_response. So we might add agent.leadership: float and set agent.leadership = genetics.leadership when creating a bird
GitHub
.
Integrate traits into simulation: Use these traits in movement and hazard logic:
Hazard Awareness: currently, all birds check if dist < hazard.radius uniformly
GitHub
. We can modify this check to incorporate awareness. For example, effectively enlarge the hazard radius for high-awareness birds. Implementation: effective_radius = hazard.radius * f(awareness) where f(awareness) might be 1 + (trait - 0.5) (so 0.5 awareness = 1x radius, 1.0 awareness = 1.5x radius, 0.0 = 0.5x radius maybe). Then use effective_radius in the distance comparison for that agent. This way, an aware bird will start reacting when further out (danger_factor kicks in earlier), whereas a low-awareness bird might not react until it's very close (almost too late).
Leadership: incorporate into flock cohesion/alignment. Possibly modify get_neighbors or how velocity alignment is applied
GitHub
. For instance, we can weight each neighbor’s influence by (neighbor_agent_owner.leadership * some factor) when computing the average velocity or center. Or simpler: identify if any neighbor has leadership > 0.8, then bias the cohesion target toward that bird’s position a bit more. This needs experimentation but even a simple rule like “the bird with highest leadership in the local neighborhood pulls others 10% more strongly” could be effective. We could add in the loop for cohesion: if neighbor has leadership L, treat the neighbor’s position as repeated L times or weight the sum.
Speed factor: Already used when creating velocity
GitHub
 and in capping max speed if energy high vs low
GitHub
. We should ensure these formulas are consistent. Perhaps raise the max speed cap slightly and incorporate speed_factor: e.g., instead of fixed 80 or 60, do max_speed = (80 if agent.energy>50 else 60) * agent.speed_factor. That way a bird with 1.1 speed_factor might have max ~88 (so 10% faster). The code currently doesn’t multiply in speed_factor on the cap, which it should for authenticity. We will add that.
Stress resilience: The code increases agent.stress in storms and predator chases
GitHub
GitHub
. We should reduce the stress increase for high resilience birds. Implementation: when applying stress += X * danger_factor, multiply X by (1 - stress_resilience) perhaps. E.g., agent.stress += 0.1 * (1 - agent_resilience) * danger_factor. If a bird has 0.8 resilience, it only gets 20% of normal stress. We have to get each bird’s resilience trait; currently agent doesn’t store it explicitly but we can derive it from genetics if needed. Perhaps easier: store agent.stress_resist = genetics.stress_resilience during creation, similar to hazard_detection, so we have it readily in simulation loop.
Beacon sensitivity: Already accounted for in Agent.beacon_response
GitHub
, but we need to apply it. In the beacon loop, we can multiply the velocity influence by agent.beacon_response. For instance, when adding velocity toward beacon
GitHub
, do agent.velocity += (to_beacon/dist) * strength * dt * agent.beacon_response. That way a bird with low sensitivity might not divert fully (perhaps drifting slower toward beacon), whereas high sensitivity bird beelines. This might already be intended but not explicitly shown in snippet, so we will add it.
Testing trait effects: Once integrated, test scenarios: e.g., spawn a high-awareness and low-awareness bird near a hazard and verify the high-awareness one turns earlier. Or place a beacon and see that a high beacon_response bird goes sooner than a low one. Adjust constants as needed for noticeable but balanced effects.
Breeding Phase Implementation:
Triggering breeding: After the final level of a migration, we need to stop the simulation (pause game time) and perform breeding. We can detect this when current_leg == total_legs and level completed (i.e., game_over or all living birds are in destination zone). The SimulationServer might receive a message or simply know when a level is last. Perhaps simpler: at level end, call a new method like GeneticSimulation.complete_migration().
Use existing breed logic: The code already has GeneticSimulation.breed_population() which does much of what we want
GitHub
GitHub
GitHub
. It finds survivors, pairs them, and creates offspring, handling multiple offspring in low-pop cases, capping population, etc. We will reuse a lot of this:
We might simplify selection (we don’t necessarily need the selective breeding by top 70% fitness as in code
GitHub
 unless we want to simulate natural selection further). The design said “exactly one per couple”, implying every surviving pair breeds regardless of fitness. To match the design prompt literally, we could ignore the fitness sorting and cutoff and just pair up as many as possible. However, the code’s approach is a bit more nuanced (to avoid weak survivors breeding if plenty of stronger ones exist). We can decide to either keep that complexity (makes the game a bit more about keeping the fittest alive) or not. A compromise: initially, breed all survivors (one offspring each pair) to align with design simplicity. If balancing becomes an issue, we can reintroduce selection.
Ensure one male, one female pairing. The code splits survivors by gender and pairs them up in order
GitHub
. That works; we’ll use it. We will drop the “top performers breed multiple times” idea for now to stick to one per pair (unless population is critically low).
Trait inheritance: The code’s Genetics.breed() method is quite detailed with group inheritance and dominant vs blend logic
GitHub
GitHub
. That actually achieves the “best of both with some randomness” that we described. So we will call Genetics.breed(parent1.genetics, parent2.genetics) to get child genetics
GitHub
. We might tweak the probabilities inside if needed to ensure it aligns with our intentions (e.g. currently 40% chance to inherit entire trait groups from one parent
GitHub
, we could adjust that). But likely it’s fine as is.
Add leadership to breeding: If we introduced leadership trait, we must update Genetics.breed to handle it. Possibly treat it in the 'social' group with cohesion and sensitivity, or add a new group. Or handle it individually like others with a dominant/blend approach (similar to what is done for each trait in code lines 125-148 for those not in groups).
Post-breeding updates: The breed code in breed_population already does: increment generation counter, create offspring via create_bird, clear and rebuild self.birds with survivors and offspring, cull or fill population to target
GitHub
GitHub
. We will reuse this but perhaps modify the target population logic:
We likely want to cap at 100 (which code sets MAX_POPULATION=100)
GitHub
 – that fits our design of ~100 size.
The code ensures minimum 50 by adding mutated new birds if under min (MIN_POPULATION=50)
GitHub
. We can keep that as it prevents game over in case of mass extinction (it’s like some birds from outside join – not realistic but a gameplay grace; or we could interpret it as “some juveniles from previous season who sat out now join”, etc.).
The survivors’ energy and state are reset for next level in that code (they do survivor.agent.energy = full, etc.)
GitHub
. That will naturally happen at the start of a new level anyway, but it’s fine.
Experience-based trait boosts: We will augment the breeding process to apply the +5% trait bonuses for special survivors before breeding. We can iterate over each survivor BirdEntity and check:
If bird.survived_levels >= total_legs_of_migration (meaning it survived the whole migration) – by definition in survivors list it did. But more specifically for leadership, check if we have tracked bird.led_time_fraction >= 0.1 (we need to accumulate during simulation how long each bird was a leader; perhaps add a field BirdEntity.lead_time or count and compute fraction = lead_time_ticks / total_ticks). For those birds, do bird.genetics.flock_cohesion += 0.05 or if we added a separate leadership trait, bird.genetics.leadership += 0.05. Clamp at max 1.0. Log this in a summary (so we can show in UI).
If bird.hazard_encounters["storm"] is True (we can set a flag if a bird went through any storm area and survived), then bird.genetics.hazard_awareness += 0.05. If storms were severe, maybe cap at some limit if done repeatedly, but likely these migrations are finite enough.
If bird.hazard_encounters["predator"] True (bird was targeted or in predator zone and lived), then bird.genetics.speed_factor = min(bird.genetics.speed_factor * 1.05, 1.2) or similar (ensuring not to exceed some realistic bound).
We must apply these before creating offspring, so that the improved values are passed to the child. The code structure could allow this: we can modify survivors’ Genetics in place after determining survivors list and before generating offspring. The fitness_score might change slightly due to this, but that’s fine.
These adjustments require that we track those encounter flags during simulation. We can set up in the simulation loop:
When a bird is inside a storm (dist < radius) mark something like bird_entity.hazard_encounters["storm"]=True.
When in predator radius and escapes, mark "predator"=True.
Leadership tracking: every few ticks, find which bird is furthest along the migration direction (max x) and increment a counter for it. Or track a small set of front-runners. This can be done in simulation_game or genetic_sim step easily by scanning positions.
Finally, incorporate these fields in the end-of-migration message so that the UI can display the achievements (e.g. “5 birds gained leadership skill” etc.).
Testing breeding: Simulate a scenario (maybe unit test level) where known survivors breed and check that offspring traits make sense (no values out of range, improvements visible). Verify population count logic (no over/under-population issues).
Procedural Level Generation & Content Scaling:
Level generator function: Create a function that given the migration index (1-based) and leg index (if needed) produces a level config (start/dest coordinates, hazards list, food sites). This can use random but seeded for reproducibility. We can base it loosely on templates from original levels for structure.
For example, for migration i, decide number of legs n (maybe n = i+1 or similar, capping at 5). For each leg j, generate:
Distance = random in [D_min, D_max] for that migration stage. We have reference distances from design doc
GitHub
. Possibly use those directly: migration1 ~40, migration2 ~60-90, etc.
Start = last leg’s destination or if first leg, fixed at A (0, some midpoint Y). Destination = (start.x + distance, some Y ± variation). We can keep Y about mid (600) with variation so that path isn’t perfectly straight – e.g. one leg could go slightly north, next south.
Place hazards: number of hazards = maybe round(i/2) for storms + round(i/2) for predators (so migration1 maybe 1 hazard total, migration5 maybe 5 hazards?). Specifically, if migration i has e.g. i storms and i predators over its entire span, distribute them among legs. For each hazard:
If storm: pick a position along the route. Possibly center it near the middle of the leg to force confrontation. radius maybe 100-150 early, up to 200 late. Strength escalate by i (10 base + 2*i for example). Add direction vector if we want it to move (maybe random direction).
If predator: position near the latter half of leg (so it catches tired birds?), or near food site (evil but interesting). Danger maybe 0.3 + 0.1i, speed maybe 5 + 1i. Possibly mark some as alpha if i large.
Place food: each leg should have at least one food. Place it roughly 50-60% of the way through the leg (so birds can reach it when they’ve used ~50% energy). Possibly adjust if hazards present – e.g. put food right after a storm as a relief. Or multiple food if distance is very long (migration5 might require two stops in one leg).
This generator can be deterministic if seeded with migration index, or we can store the generated outputs so that retries load the same hazards.
Integration: When starting a migration, instead of loading from static levels.json, call this generator to create each level’s config and perhaps store it in a temporary structure (or monkey-patch into levels dict so that from_level can retrieve it
GitHub
 without needing actual file). Or directly bypass GameConfig.from_level and use our own logic to set GameConfig/GeneticSimulation parameters.
Difficulty parameters: Possibly maintain a config file or constants for min/max values of hazards per migration. We can refine these after testing to ensure gradual ramp. Use debug runs to see that Migration1 is indeed easy, Migration5 indeed hard.
Testing fairness: Simulate using an automated run or careful playthrough that each generated level is winnable with a decent strategy. Adjust randomness if something unfair arises (like a storm exactly covering the only food – that could kill everyone; maybe ensure food isn’t inside a storm radius by adjusting positions).
Progress save: If the campaign is long, consider allowing the player to restart a migration if they fail (they’d lose that generation perhaps) or save progress after each migration. This might be beyond immediate scope, but note it.
Visual and UI Updates:
Rendering differences: Implement gender-based color variation. Likely in the rendering code (Phaser), when drawing an agent, check agent.gender and tint accordingly. The data already sends breed or we can send a gender flag for each agent in the state_update message. Possibly the breed field in state_update
GitHub
 was intended for genetic mode info (it’s empty in our usage, we might repurpose it or add a new field “gender”: "M"/"F"). Do similarly for generation (could encode generation number to maybe the color hue or send explicitly for UI to display as text on hover).
Click for stats panel: Extend the agent click logic to show our new traits. We will create a UI component (e.g. an overlay or sidebar) that populates with the selected bird’s details. This can query the server for that bird’s full data if not already available. The server has send_family_tree and such, implying we can fetch lineage on click
GitHub
. At minimum, we show current trait values (in percentages or bars) and possibly a mini family tree (bird’s parents and any offspring if applicable). This leverages existing genetics tracking (the server maintains family_trees and could provide it).
End-of-migration screen: Develop a new UI screen that triggers on migration completion. The server can send a summary message, or the client can compile from the data it has. We might have the server send a special “migration_complete” event containing:
Count of survivors (with breakdown by gender and perhaps listing any special survivors).
Count of offspring produced.
A list of trait averages before vs after breeding (we can compute pre-breeding avg and post-breeding avg easily via PopulationStats
GitHub
).
Names/IDs of birds that got bonuses (the ones we gave +5% leadership etc.) and what they got, so we can highlight “Bird 27 got +Leadership for leading the flock”.
Any “retired” birds if we remove old generation beyond lifespan (the code retires after 3 generations by default
GitHub
). We can mention if some of the very original Gen0 finally died of old age or were retired.
The UI will present this info in a clear format, using maybe charts or lists. We should also give the player a choice here like “Proceed to next migration” button, allowing a moment to digest info.
HUD changes in-level: Add small indicators to birds if needed (like a crown icon on a leader bird, or a skull icon briefly over a bird that just died). And on the HUD, display number of birds remaining vs start, so player knows losses at a glance. Possibly an energy gauge visual for the whole flock (maybe an average energy or a graph of how many are in each energy range).
Test UI: Ensure that performance is okay when showing stats for up to 100 birds. The current implementation only sends up to 300 agents data per tick
GitHub
 which is fine. We might extend each agent’s data to include gender and generation for easier client rendering.
Testing & Balancing:
Conduct several test playthroughs (or simulations) of the campaign. Use logging to verify that:
Energy consumption feels right (birds reach food with just a bit of energy left if guided well; if mismanaged, they run out around 10% and die as intended).
Hazard interactions yield some losses but not total flock wipes if handled; e.g., in a storm maybe 10-20% birds die from exhaustion or lightning if the player went through it, which might be acceptable, whereas smart avoidance could reduce that.
Predators kill a few birds but many escape – adjust predator danger or chase time if needed. Check that fast birds do survive more often.
Breeding results in noticeable trait improvements. After two migrations, see that, say, average endurance went up and indeed the flock performs better (maybe they can handle a slightly longer flight without extra food).
Difficulty ramps appropriately – by final migration, without those improvements the flock would have a hard time, but with them it’s manageable (still challenging).
Pay attention to edge cases: what if in Migration 1 the player loses 90% of birds but 5 survive and breed? The next gen will be small (maybe repopulated to 50 by code). Is it still feasible to continue? Possibly yes, with some random new birds (mutation) injected. We might consider a soft fail state or difficulty adjustment if a flock is nearly wiped out (or just rely on repopulating to give the player another chance at cost of genetic quality).
Balance beacon usage: does the player have enough beacons to reasonably guide the flock through hazards and to food? If not, consider increasing beacon budget or beacon effectiveness.
Ensure performance remains good with these changes (the flock size is same, but we added some computations per agent – should be fine given numpy vectorization for many parts).
Lastly, update any tutorials or in-game help to explain these new mechanics (for example, an intro tooltip: “Lead your flock from one feeding ground to the next. Place beacons to guide them. Watch their energy – if it drops too low, they’ll perish mid-flight!”).
By following this roadmap, we will replace the old sandbox/campaign mechanics with a cohesive new system focused on survival, strategic routing, and genetic progression. The codebase already has strong foundations (flocking, hazards, basic genetics) that we are expanding upon. Each step above corresponds to concrete changes (with source references) ensuring we leverage existing functionality

 and add what’s missing. This transformation will deliver a compelling gameplay experience where each migration feels like a meaningful journey and each new generation of birds stands a better chance against an increasingly harsh world. Sources:

Full Audit of Murmuration Codebase Against Roadmap2

Roadmap Implementation Audit
Delivered Features: Many Phase 1 items are implemented. The game now has a multi-leg migration structure with a “Next Leg” flow (manual progression) and persistent genetic traits. Environmental food sites are generated and rendered on the map with green pulsing icons and restore bird energy when flocks enter the radius
GitHub
GitHub
. Player-placed food beacons have indeed been removed in favor of these static sites (the code rejects any 'food' beacon placement)
GitHub
. The beacon system includes a budget (e.g. beacon_budget=3 for wind beacons) and limits spamming. Birds are now gender-differentiated – male birds get a subtle blue tint in-game
GitHub
 and UI panels use blue/rose colors and symbols
GitHub
. The hazard mechanics have advanced: storms use a custom sprite (tornado.png) and have multi-tier danger zones
GitHub
GitHub
, and predators use chase logic (timed pursuit with fatigue) so that their kill chance drops if birds evade long enough
GitHub
GitHub
. The game’s telemetry HUD (left panel) and genetics panel (right panel) provide real-time stats on flock health, cohesion, energy, and trait averages as intended. Bird inspection pop-ups are implemented on click, showing individual stats and trait bars
GitHub
GitHub
, fulfilling the “bird inspection” UI goal. Core flock evolution between migrations is partially there – after a full migration, survivors get trait boosts (e.g. +0.08 hazard awareness for storm survivors) and breeding occurs to replenish the flock
GitHub
GitHub
. Performance considerations like object pooling, frustum culling, etc., are also present in the code. These delivered features align well with the Roadmap Phase 1 goals (e.g. slowing bird speed, using storm assets, gender visuals, basic beacon strategy). Missing / Incomplete Features: Several critical roadmap items are not fully realized. Notably, the strategic gameplay loop is only half-implemented – while multiple legs exist, the flock does not truly persist across legs. The code currently resets the bird count to 100 at the start of each new leg regardless of survivors, instead of carrying over only the survivors. In the server’s migration code, after a leg ends it logs continuing with X survivors but then calls load_level for the next leg without actually using those survivors
GitHub
GitHub
. This means casualties don’t impact the next leg’s starting population – a design break from the roadmap’s intent of dwindling flocks (the Roadmap’s “persisting state between levels” is effectively missing). Difficulty progression is therefore flatter than intended. Also missing is a dedicated migration results screen or final summary – upon finishing all legs there is no polished end-of-migration UI to recap trait evolution or generation changes (breeding happens in code, but the player isn’t presented with a results overview, contrary to roadmap UI goals). The level design/checkpoint progression is only rudimentary: the journey uses fixed templates (e.g. “W1-1” levels) instead of a fully procedural A→B→C path generation – it works, but lacks variety and narrative context (Phase 2/3 plans like dynamic leg count or seasonal variations aren’t in place). In terms of hazards, while storms are visualized, predator visuals are missing – the code loads predator.png but never actually adds predator sprites to the scene
GitHub
GitHub
, so predators are invisible (only their effect radius is shown). UI/UX feedback is also incomplete: e.g. there’s no on-screen indicator of beacon quantity used/remaining, even though beacon_budget is tracked (this could be shown on the HUD). And although traits do evolve, there’s no trait evolution visualization between migrations (no graph or summary for how genetics changed generation to generation, which was a roadmap item). These gaps mean some Phase 2 depth (like moving hazards, advanced beacon types, or the breeding selection UI) is not yet present – understandable at this stage, but worth noting for completeness.
Display & UI Issues
1. Overlapping Pop-ups and Blurred Screen: There are problems with multiple UI windows stacking and obscuring the game. For example, the level transition panels (the large center screen pop-ups for “Start Level” and “Leg Complete”) use a full-screen semi-transparent backdrop. If another window (like the bird-inspection panel) is open underneath, it remains active and becomes faintly visible through the dark overlay, causing a confusing double-UI effect. Currently, nothing triggers the bird info panel to close when a level-completion panel appears. Solution: ensure only one popup at a time. We can fix this by forcibly hiding secondary pop-ups whenever a major modal opens. For instance, when showing the level-complete panel, call hideBirdInspection() to destroy any inspection panel still open. This can be done in the main event handler for level completion. For example:
// In main.ts, after receiving level_complete:
if (data.type === 'level_completed') {
    uiScene.showCompletionPanel(data.data);
    gameScene.hideBirdInspection();  // Close any bird info pop-up
}
This way, the bird info window won’t linger behind the blurred overlay. Similarly, if there are other small panels (settings, etc.), they should be closed or suspended when a full-screen modal is active. 2. Multiple Modal Overlays (“Double Blur”): The design of UIScene.createLevelPanel() already tries to prevent multiple overlays by destroying any existing panel before creating a new one
GitHub
. However, due to how the panel is reused between level start and completion, a logic bug allows the backdrop to “double up.” After a level, the code repurposes the same panel for the completion screen (changing text to “CONTINUE…”) and then hides it. On the next level start, it reuses the hidden panel instead of fully rebuilding it, so it doesn’t re-add the backdrop – if something triggers creation of a second backdrop, the screen can become overly dark. The safer approach is to always destroy and recreate the panel for a new level rather than hiding and reusing it. We can tweak the logic in showLevelPanel to rebuild the UI if it was previously used for a completion. For example:
public showLevelPanel(levelNumber: number, ... ) {
    // If panel was used for completion before, destroy it to reset state
    if (this.isCompletionPanel && this.levelPanel) {
        this.levelPanel.destroy();
        this.levelPanel = null;
        this.isCompletionPanel = false;
    }
    if (!this.levelPanel) {
        this.createLevelPanel();
    }
    // ...then update texts as usual
}
This ensures the backdrop and text are always in a clean state. It prevents any cumulative darkening or blurring from reusing an already semi-transparent overlay. After implementing this, the screen will have only one correct overlay at a time, keeping the display crisp. 3. Modal Button Text/State Not Reset: A related UI bug is that the “Start Level” button text isn’t reverting properly. On level completion, the code updates the panel’s button to say “CONTINUE TO NEXT LEG”
GitHub
, but when the next level loads, the panel is reused without changing it back, so players have seen the wrong button label. As noted, rebuilding the panel each time is one fix. Alternatively, we could explicitly reset the button. For instance, at the top of showLevelPanel, if this.isCompletionPanel was true, we know the button says “CONTINUE…”, so we can find that text and set it to “START LEVEL” again (and restore its green styling). Recreating the panel (as above) is simpler – it naturally resets the text to the default “START LEVEL” as defined in createLevelPanel()
GitHub
. This fix will eliminate the confusion of seeing “Continue” when a level hasn’t started yet. 4. Camera Not Initially Following Flock: Currently the camera starts in manual mode, which is not beginner-friendly – birds can fly off-screen because the player must actively pan or toggle the camera mode. The code defaults cameraMode = 'manual'
GitHub
, meaning the view will not track the flock unless the user knows to press C (cycle camera) to enable “Follow Flock” mode
GitHub
. As the user noted, “levels and the playing field are not restricted to the window” – this is essentially because of the manual camera allowing the flock to leave the view. The game should feel more polished by making the camera auto-follow by default. Solution: set the initial camera mode to 'flock_follow'. For example, in GameScene’s constructor or create, initialize this.cameraMode = 'flock_follow'; instead of manual. And/or call cycleCameraMode() once on scene start to switch to follow mode automatically. Additionally, we might call the existing frameAllBirds() once the first level starts, so the camera zooms out to fit the whole flock nicely at the beginning. This one-line change (setting the default mode) ensures the action stays on-screen and “things [don’t] happen outside of the camera.” The camera bounds are already set to the world size
GitHub
, so it won’t wander beyond the map. After this fix, the flock will remain in view, greatly improving perceived professionalism of the display. 5. Minor Visual Polish Issues: A few smaller display quirks can be addressed for a truly impeccable look. For example, the predator hazard currently has no visual representation, which can confuse players (birds might die “out of nowhere”). We should render the predator sprite on the map when a predator hazard spawns. The code has a loaded texture predator_sprite
GitHub
; we can add logic in the hazard renderer (similar to the tornado sprite usage
GitHub
) to create an image for predators. For instance, inside createHazardVisual() in GameScene, add: if (hazard.type === 'predator') { /* add predator sprite at hazard.position, perhaps an animated eagle icon, with some tween for circling motion */ }. This gives players a visual cue of the threat. We should also ensure the HUD panels don’t overlap important content – currently the left HUD and right genetics panel are semi-transparent and nicely sized, so this is okay, but if any panel obscures too much of the play area (especially on smaller screens), we might consider allowing players to toggle them. Given the roadmap’s focus on accessibility, we might add a key (like H) to hide/show the HUD for an unobstructed view, though this is a feature suggestion beyond bug fixes. Lastly, verifying that text contrast and sizes are consistent will add polish – e.g. the level titles and subtitles on the panels use a smaller font for subtitles (“Migration Leg A-B”) which sometimes might not stand out against the backdrop. Using a slightly larger or brighter font for the subtitle could improve readability on some displays. These are fine-tuning suggestions to reach that “impeccable” visual quality.
Game Balance and Mechanics Issues
1. Hazard Lethality & Difficulty Curve: The current hazard settings are still quite punishing and may need tuning for balance. The roadmap analysis noted storm and predator kill chances were high, and the code has adjusted storms to ~5–14% kill chance (down from 8–18%)
GitHub
 which is good. Predators, however, still have up to an 18% base kill chance in later legs
GitHub
 (down from 25%, but starting at ~10% for leg1). This might still feel high when combined with the new chase mechanics. If playtesting shows frequent flock wipeouts, consider reducing predator kill chance further to, say, 5% base + 1.5%/leg (so ~5–11%) or making predators wound instead of outright kill some percentage of the time. The hazard frequency could also scale more gently – currently hazard_count = migration_id (1 storm in migration1, but up to 4 in migration4 plus predators)
GitHub
. If players are losing too many birds early, we might start with 1 hazard for first two migrations, then increase. In code, that’s easy to adjust in MigrationConfig.generate_leg or the hazard generation logic. 2. Energy & Food Balance: The distance-based energy consumption and food site placement seem well thought-out (each leg is designed to require at least one stop)
GitHub
GitHub
. One potential balance issue is how quickly energy refills at food sites. The code sets an energy_restore_rate (8.0 in generation for some legs)
GitHub
 and the BeaconManager uses that to give energy back at restore_rate per tick strength
GitHub
. We should verify that birds actually get back to 100% energy when lingering at a food site. If not, we may need to increase that rate or the radius so more birds can feed simultaneously. Another consideration: since players no longer place food beacons, they have less direct control – thus the fixed food sites must be forgiving enough in placement. We might randomize food a bit less (currently Y is random 400–800) so that it doesn’t spawn too far off the flock’s likely path. Keeping food within a reasonable band ensures players always have a viable route. 3. Population Carry-Over & Difficulty: As mentioned, the game currently replenishes the flock to 100 birds each leg, which makes the game easier (you essentially get a full-strength flock every leg). This is both a balance and a design issue. The intent was likely that if you finish Leg 1 with 80 birds alive, you start Leg 2 with 80 birds – making later legs harder if you took heavy losses. Right now, because the code calls self.birds.clear() and refills the population to 100 every time during breeding or level load
GitHub
GitHub
, the challenge of maintaining your flock is lost. To fix this, we have a couple of options:
Use the UnifiedSimulation approach: Instead of fully terminating the simulation each leg, we could run one continuous simulation across legs. The UnifiedSimulation class actually supports multi-leg progression with persistent birds (see its advance_to_next_leg logic which repositions survivors and refills energy
GitHub
GitHub
). Switching to use unified_sim for the journey would inherently carry over only survivors (and it already handles breeding after the final leg). This would be a larger refactor on the server side, but it aligns exactly with the roadmap vision.
Adjust the EvolvedSimulation path: If we stick to loading a new level each leg, we can modify the server logic to pass the number of survivors into the next level’s setup. For example, after a leg, we know how many birds survived (survivors = self.simulation.arrivals in server.py)
GitHub
. We could instantiate the next level’s GameConfig with n_agents = survivors instead of always 100. Additionally, we’d want to carry over the breed (genetic distribution) of those survivors. Right now the code calls self.simulation.evolve_breed() at level end (which averages traits into a Breed object)
GitHub
, then uses that breed for the next level’s config
GitHub
. That maintains trait progression, but it doesn’t reduce the population. To enforce losses, we could skip auto-breeding between legs and directly reuse the surviving agents. A quick hack: get the list of survivor BirdEntities from the old simulation and manually initialize the new simulation’s population with those (and fill up with some offspring if you want to keep 100 as an upper cap). This would require exposing a method to spawn a simulation with a given list of birds or feeding the survivors into the GeneticSimulation’s breeding function with a cap. It’s non-trivial but doable – since the code already has a concept of survivors list and offspring creation, we could intercept it. For example, instead of always doing if total_candidates > max_population: ... then cutting to 100
GitHub
, we could allow fewer. We might set max_population = survivors_count from last leg when calling the breeding for the next leg (if not final breeding). This way the next level starts with that smaller number.
In summary, not refilling the flock fully between legs will make the game more challenging and aligned with expectations. Whichever approach, we should test and ensure a player can still feasibly complete the entire migration – we may need to adjust food or hazards to compensate for potentially smaller flocks in later legs. 4. Trait Evolution and Breeding Balance: The genetic trait progression seems solid (small bonuses for survivors of hazards, etc.), but one thing to watch is trait amplification over many generations. Since the game can potentially run indefinitely (if players keep succeeding), traits like speed_factor get multiplied by 1.05 for each predator “close call”
GitHub
. Over many generations, could this push some traits to their caps too fast or create unbalanced super-birds? The code caps speed_factor at 1.2
GitHub
 and other traits at 1.0 max, so that’s good. We might consider adding slight random mutations occasionally to keep diversity (the roadmap mentioned mutation rates, but I didn’t see a clear random mutation implementation in the breeding logic beyond experience bonuses). Ensuring that not all birds become identical over time can maintain the need for strategy. Another balance consideration is beacon effectiveness: with limited beacons, we increased their strength. The BeaconType.WIND_LURE (formerly “thermal”) for example now likely has a stronger push on birds. We should verify in playtesting that using a wind beacon actually creates a noticeable difference in the flock’s path – if not, we may increase its radius or effect so that spending a beacon feels worthwhile. 5. Difficulty Progression: The game is intended to get harder each migration. Presently, hazard strength does scale with migration_id (storms get +3 strength per migration, etc.)
GitHub
 and number of legs increases (up to 5 legs by migration 4). This is good. We should also perhaps scale food scarcity: later migrations might have legs so long that even with 3 food sites it’s tough to reach the next one. If we want to enforce use of evolved traits, we could shorten the distance between food in early migrations and lengthen in later ones. The code currently randomizes leg distance 800–1200 (which already might be quite tough if at upper range with only 3 food sites). We can monitor player success rate; the roadmap’s goal was ~60–80% first-time completion for early migrations
GitHub
. If it’s lower, we’ll tweak by either adding an extra food site or lowering energy burn (the energy_efficiency trait could be made more impactful to simulate better endurance in later generations). In summary, the balance is on the right track but will need iterative tuning. Reducing early frustration (hazard insta-kills, flock flying off-screen, etc.) is priority. The fixes to camera and UI will help with frustration unrelated to design, and then tweaking numbers (hazard odds, predator behavior, refilling between legs) will make the gameplay challenge feel fair and winnable.
Level Progression & Panel Workflow Issues
1. Level Generation “Broken” (Persistence): As discussed, the multi-leg progression has a logic flaw where each leg is essentially treated as a fresh start in terms of bird count. This can feel “broken” from a gameplay continuity perspective. A player who sees only 50 birds survive a gauntlet might be confused when 100 birds appear at the next checkpoint. To fix this, we should implement true persistence of the flock across legs. The best solution is to leverage the existing MigrationManager/UnifiedSimulation more fully. The code already defines a MigrationJourney with checkpoints A, B, C...
GitHub
 and a continue_to_next_leg() that resets positions and refills energy
GitHub
. We should use that in the server flow instead of tearing down the sim each time. Concretely, after a leg is completed, rather than calling a new load_level, we can call unified_sim.continue_to_next_leg() (if using unified) or simulate that behavior by carrying survivors as described. This will make level generation feel consistent – events that happened in the prior leg (deaths, trait gains) directly affect the next leg. It also means the “panel between levels” can display accurate information. Right now the transition panel after a leg shows the number of survivors, but then the next “Start Level” panel always says “Your Flock: 50 Males, 50 Females” (since it assumes 100 birds split evenly). This is misleading when, say, only 80 actually survived. We can improve the panel data by passing the real survivor counts. The showLevelPanel() is already called with parameters for males/females
GitHub
 – we need the server to send updated values. The server’s level_loaded message currently always uses the original 100 split
GitHub
. If we carry survivors, we can adjust males and females in that message for legs beyond the first. Implementing persistence will automatically solve this: e.g. if 80 survive Leg 1, when starting Leg 2, total_birds = 80 and we send that. In code, we could capture the survivor count from the previous leg’s level_completed data (already sent as survivors
GitHub
) and use it for the next level_loaded. This would make the level start panel accurately reflect, say, “Your Flock: 40 Males, 40 Females” if 80 remain. 2. Panel Sequence and Timing: There is a slight UX timing issue at the start of the game: on connecting, the code sometimes shows the level start panel immediately (due to the onConnectionChange handler) and the server might simultaneously send a level_loaded. This caused a flicker where the panel might appear twice in quick succession (or the backdrop gets redrawn). The code attempts to handle it by using the levelStartRequested flag
GitHub
, but if the timing is off, the panel could pop up, disappear, then reappear. We should test this and, if it’s happening, simplify the logic. One approach: do not automatically show the panel on connect; rely on the level_loaded message from the server to trigger it. The server already sends level_loaded as soon as the first level is ready
GitHub
. We could remove the setTimeout call that shows the panel on connection
GitHub
 to avoid a race. This way, there’s a single source of truth for when to display the Start Level panel (the server event). 3. Continuation Flow: After a leg is complete, the Continue button triggers continueToNextLeg which sends a continue_migration message. The server then loads the next level and eventually sends a new level_loaded. Right now, the client’s logic sets a flag to avoid redisplaying the panel automatically in this case
GitHub
GitHub
. We should double-check that workflow – if any bug causes that flag not to be set or cleared properly, the panel might not show when it should, or vice versa. In testing, ensure that: (a) after clicking Continue, the next level does indeed start paused and the Start panel is shown (currently it is designed not to show because the assumption is the user just clicked start, but now it’s a new level). Actually, looking at the code: when the user clicks Continue, levelStartRequested is set to true
GitHub
, so when the new level_loaded arrives, the panel is suppressed
GitHub
. This means the next leg starts immediately without giving the player a chance to review the new leg info or catch their breath – likely not intended. The roadmap called for a pause at checkpoints. We likely want to always show the Start panel at each leg, not skip it. To fix this, we should not treat a continue as a reason to skip the panel. The levelStartRequested flag approach is appropriate for when the user has already explicitly started a level (to avoid showing the panel twice for the same leg), but on a new leg it should reset. In fact, the code does this.levelStartRequested = false after using it
GitHub
. However, because the flag is set true before sending continue_migration, the new level_loaded comes while it’s true and gets suppressed. The fix could be to move levelStartRequested = false to right before showing the panel for the new leg. E.g., in the server’s migration_continued or just on the client, simply don’t reuse levelStartRequested for continues. We can manage it more simply: always show showLevelPanel on any level_loaded for a new leg, and only use that flag to avoid an immediate panel when the player initially presses Start for leg 1. In summary, clean up the continue-to-next-leg flow so that each leg still begins with a paused state and a panel (like a checkpoint briefing). This will improve the pacing and clarity between levels. 4. Panel Data and Formatting: We touched on panel accuracy; one more tweak: The “LEVEL 1” title vs “MIGRATION LEG 1” wording can be standardized. Right now the code sets the title to "LEVEL 1" initially and then updates it to "MIGRATION LEG X" dynamically
GitHub
. It might be better to consistently call it “Leg 1, Leg 2, ...” or include the checkpoint names (the Roadmap suggested labels like A→B). We have the leg_name from the server (e.g. “Breeding Grounds to Coastal Wetlands”) which we do show as a subtitle. That’s great context; we should ensure those names update correctly each leg (they do get passed in the level_loaded data
GitHub
). If any inconsistency is found (for instance, the first panel default subtitle is “Migration Leg A-B” hardcoded, then it gets updated), we can initialize it blank and always fill from server data to avoid confusion. Also, on the completion panel, the subtitle shows “X/Y birds survived (Z%)” which is excellent feedback
GitHub
. One small bug: if zero birds die (i.e. all 100 survived), the text might read “100/100 survived (100%)” which is fine – but if all birds die, we should handle that (currently, if survivors=0, it would say “0/100 birds survived (0%)”, and presumably the game ends). Perhaps in that case we’d want a different message (“All birds were lost!” and a restart prompt) – but that veers into design choice. For now, the completion panel logic is okay, but just ensure that if survivors == 0 the game doesn’t try to proceed to next leg (the server does send a migration_complete or failure message in that case). We might want to intercept that and show a Game Over screen instead of the generic completion panel. That could be a future addition: e.g., if survivors===0, show a modal saying “Migration Failed – no survivors. Try Again.” Currently, I suspect the game just pauses on game over with no victory, and perhaps the user must manually restart. Adding a failure popup would improve UX. In summary, addressing these panel and progression issues will make the game flow much more intuitive. The transitions will correctly reflect the state of the flock and give players proper control at checkpoints. After these fixes – correct survivor counts, camera following, single modals – the game should both look and feel far more polished and true to its design intent.
Code Snippets for Key Fixes
Below are concise code examples implementing some of the above fixes:
Default Camera Follow Mode (in GameScene.ts constructor or init):
this.cameraMode = 'flock_follow';  // start in follow mode instead of 'manual'
This one-liner ensures the camera tracks the flock immediately. No more birds wandering off-screen.
Resetting Level Panel on New Leg (part of UIScene.showLevelPanel):
if (this.isCompletionPanel && this.levelPanel) {
    this.levelPanel.destroy();
    this.levelPanel = null;
    this.isCompletionPanel = false;
}
if (!this.levelPanel) {
    this.createLevelPanel();
}
// Now update text fields for the new leg:
if (levelTitle) levelTitle.setText(`MIGRATION LEG ${levelNumber}`);
// ... etc.
This ensures a fresh panel each time. We destroy the old one if it was showing a completion, so we don’t carry over any stale state (text, colors, or the semi-transparent backdrop). Then we safely create a new panel for the upcoming leg.
Hiding BirdInspection on Level Popup (in main event handler for level loaded/completed):
// After showing the panel (level start or completion)
uiScene.showLevelPanel(...);
gameScene.hideBirdInspection();
By doing this, we proactively clean up the bird detail pop-up anytime we bring up a big modal. The hideBirdInspection() method already destroys the panel if it exists
GitHub
.
Using Survivor Count for Next Level (conceptual server-side change):
Instead of always starting each leg with 100 birds, modify continue_migration to pass survivors:
if self.current_leg < self.max_legs:
    survivors = [agent for agent in self.simulation.agents if agent.alive]
    survivor_count = len(survivors)
    self.current_leg += 1
    # ... prepare next level ID
    next_level = f"W1-{self.current_leg}"
    # Use survivors count in next level config
    config = GameConfig.from_level(next_level, seed=seed, breed=self.current_breed, n_agents=survivor_count)
    self.simulation = EvolvedSimulation(config)
    # Possibly carry over genetics of survivors into self.current_breed before this
    ...
(Note: The above is a sketch – in practice we might integrate with GeneticSimulation to carry the actual individuals. But even setting n_agents = survivor_count will make the next sim start with fewer birds.) This change will directly enforce losses to matter. We’d also adjust the UI message when loading the level to use survivor_count for males/females.
Predator Sprite Rendering (in GameScene.createHazardVisual or similar):
if (hazard.type === 'predator') {
    const predatorSprite = this.add.image(0, 0, 'predator_sprite');
    predatorSprite.setScale(0.5);
    predatorSprite.setTint(0xff4444);
    // perhaps add some tween to indicate motion or hovering
    container.add(predatorSprite);
}
This would draw the predator on the hazard container at the appropriate location. We might use a small scale and a red tint or shadow to distinguish it. Now players will see an eagle icon when a predator is present, rather than just a circle.
Level Start Panel always shown on new leg: We will remove the condition that skips the panel after continue. In practice, this means not carrying over levelStartRequested = true across legs. We can simply do:
// in onMessage handling 'level_loaded':
uiScene.showLevelPanel(...); 
// (remove the if(!levelStartRequested) check entirely for new legs)
And ensure that when the user clicks “Start Level”, we only prevent the panel from reappearing for that same level. This fix is more about reorganizing logic than code to insert, but it’s important to mention in implementation notes.
By implementing these fixes and adjustments, display issues (like overlapping pop-ups and off-camera action) will be resolved, and gameplay issues (like lack of persistence and balance quirks) will be much closer to the roadmap’s vision. The result will be a more professional, polished Murmuration game: the UI will be clean and uncluttered, the camera will always showcase the flock’s journey, and the strategic challenge of guiding a dwindling flock through perils will be properly realized. All these changes steer the project toward the impeccable look and engaging feel expected from the design documents.

Would it be hard to make this game available on steam?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19s
Short answer: not hard—moderate. Murmuration (TypeScript + Phaser) is web-tech, so you package it as a desktop app and use Steamworks. The work is mostly packaging + store setup—not a rewrite.

What you need
Steamworks partner account (+ one-time app fee).

Desktop build (Win mandatory; macOS/Linux optional) via Electron or NW.js.

Steamworks integration (achievements, cloud saves—optional).

Store page assets (capsules, screenshots, trailer) + pricing/ratings/tax info.

Tech plan (Phaser → Steam)
Wrap the game

Use Electron; point the BrowserWindow at your local index.html.

Enable DPI scaling, vsync-friendly settings, and fullscreen.

// electron/main.ts
import { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron';

const createWindow = () => {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 1600,
    height: 900,
    useContentSize: true,
    resizable: true,
    fullscreenable: true,
    backgroundColor: '#000000',
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: false,
      contextIsolation: true,
      webSecurity: true
    }
  });
  win.setMenuBarVisibility(false);
  win.loadFile('dist/index.html'); // your Phaser build
};

app.on('ready', createWindow);
app.on('window-all-closed', () => process.platform !== 'darwin' && app.quit());
app.on('activate', () => BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0 && createWindow());
Package builds

Use electron-builder for win (nsis), mac (dmg/notarized), linux (AppImage).

Example package.json:

{
  "name": "murmuration",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "electron/main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dist:win": "electron-builder -w nsis",
    "dist:mac": "electron-builder -m",
    "dist:linux": "electron-builder -l AppImage"
  },
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.king.murmuration",
    "files": ["dist/**", "electron/**"],
    "win": { "target": ["nsis"] },
    "mac": { "category": "public.app-category.games" },
    "linux": { "target": ["AppImage"] }
  }
}
Steamworks (optional but recommended)

Use greenworks (Electron Steamworks binding) for overlay/achievements.

Minimal init + achievement:

// preload.ts (expose a tiny API to the renderer)
import * as greenworks from 'greenworks';
(globalThis as any).steam = greenworks.init() ? greenworks : null;

// in Phaser code
const steam: any = (window as any).steam;
if (steam) steam.activateGameOverlay && steam.activateGameOverlay('Friends');
// unlock on milestone:
if (steam) steam.activateAchievement('FIRST_MIGRATION');
Cloud saves: use Steam Auto-Cloud. Save to a fixed path, e.g.:

%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Roaming/Murmuration/saves/*.json
~/Library/Application Support/Murmuration/saves/*.json
Then declare that pattern in Steamworks (no code change).

Upload builds (SteamPipe)

Create app + depots (Win/Mac/Linux).

Use SteamCMD with simple VDFs:

// app_build_123456.vdf
"AppBuild"
{
"AppID" "123456"
"Desc" "Initial release"
"BuildOutput" "..\output"
"ContentRoot" "..\release"
"Depots"
{
"123457" "depot_win.vdf"
}
}


5. **Store page & compliance**
- Fill out pricing, regional tax, **IARC** questionnaire, age gates.
- Upload **capsules/screens/trailer**. (Follow Steam’s current size specs.)
- Request **release-ready review**, set release date, configure **Playtest** (optional).

## Gotchas to handle
- **Hi-DPI**: in Phaser config set `resolution: window.devicePixelRatio`, and in Electron disable Chromium’s background throttling if you pause the app in background.
- **Fullscreen & controllers**: test fullscreen transitions; map basic controller inputs if desired.
- **Code signing**: Windows and macOS signing/notarization improve trust/AV false positives.
- **Licenses/third-party**: verify you can redistribute all assets (fonts, sounds).

## Effort level
- **Packaging & Steam integration**: straightforward with Electron + greenworks.
- **Store setup**: admin/content work (assets, text, pricing).
- **QA**: make sure performance, windowing, and save paths behave across OSes.

If you want, I can produce:
- An **Electron wrapper** PR around your current client build,
- **SteamPipe** scripts (VDFs) and a **CI job** to push branches to Steam beta,
- A **checklist** of store assets/descriptions tailored to Murmuration’s theme.

Ok instead, how can I keep it browser based but make money with it and do performance marketing?
ChatGPT said:
To keep Murmuration browser-based but still monetize and run performance marketing, you’d essentially be building a free-to-play web game with monetization hooks. Here’s a complete breakdown:

1. Monetization Models
Advertising

Interstitials / rewarded ads: e.g. AdInPlay, Google AdSense for Games, GameMonetize.

Rewarded video: players watch a short ad to get an extra beacon or second chance.

Needs integration of a JS SDK.

In-Game Purchases (IAP)

Cosmetic skins for birds, backgrounds, or flock trails.

“Premium mode”: remove ads, unlock more beacons, special genetics tracking UI.

Browser payments: Stripe, Xsolla, or Paddle can integrate directly with your TypeScript client.

Premium Access / Subscriptions

A “Pro” tier with advanced stats, special scenarios, or persistent flock storage.

Could be run via Patreon-style subscription linked to player accounts.

Hybrid

Ads for free users + microtransactions to skip ads or unlock cosmetics.

2. Distribution Channels
Own website / custom domain: Full control, embed analytics, run campaigns.

Game portals: itch.io, CrazyGames, Kongregate Web, Poki — they bring organic traffic, share ad revenue, and sometimes handle monetization.

Social platforms: Instant Games on Facebook, Snap Games (if lightweight enough).

3. Performance Marketing (User Acquisition)
Tracking setup

Use Google Tag Manager to fire conversion events (e.g. tutorial complete, migration finished).

Implement Facebook Pixel + Google Ads Conversion Tags to track paid campaigns.

Consider Adjust or GameAnalytics for cohort analysis.

Campaign types

Google UAC (App-like campaigns): target players across Search, YouTube, Display.

Facebook/Instagram ads: great for demo targeting (casual puzzle/strategy players).

Reddit/TikTok ads: interest-based micro-targeting (nature, simulation games).

Optimize for first session length > N min or “completed first migration”.

Creatives

Short video loops of flocks dodging predators, with tagline: “Can your flock survive the storm?”.

Show progression (from small flock → large evolved flock).

Key art (which you already started) repurposed for banners.

4. Tech Considerations for Browser Monetization
Account / save system

Optional, but helps retention and monetization. Store progress in localStorage or allow cloud save with Firebase/Auth0.

Cross-platform

Ensure it runs on desktop & mobile browsers. Many users will come from mobile ads → landing page → immediate play.

Performance

Optimize Phaser rendering (pooling, culling). Browser players churn fast if FPS stutters.

5. Step-by-Step Path
Integrate analytics + ads SDK (Google AdSense for Games, or a mediation partner like GameMonetize).

Design monetization hooks (rewarded ad → extra beacon, $3 premium unlock).

Ship a playable build on your own landing page with a clean CTA (Play Free).

Add tracking pixels for Google & Meta.

Run small ad campaigns ($500–1k test budget) to measure CPI, session length, conversion to premium.

Iterate: adjust difficulty, ad frequency, and monetization placement for balance.

👉 This way you can keep Murmuration as a seamless browser game, but still have a revenue model and scalable performance marketing.

Would you like me to draft a technical integration plan for ads + Stripe payments inside your existing TypeScript/Phaser codebase (with code snippets for SDK hooks)? That would make this actionable for your team.

You said:
How can we make the game more beautiful? With better animations? Should we change the tech?
ChatGPT said:
Great question. Right now you’re using Phaser + TypeScript. Phaser is excellent for 2D casual gameplay, but its rendering style is more “functional” than “cinematic.” Making Murmuration more beautiful is about layering polish on top of the flocking mechanics. Here are some practical paths:

1. Better Animations (Still in Phaser)
You don’t necessarily need to switch tech yet. Phaser can look stunning with the right assets + shaders:

Bird Animation

Instead of static sprites, use a 2–3 frame wing-flap cycle per bird. Even if tiny, it adds life.

Use Phaser’s anims.create for lightweight looped animation.

Smooth Interpolation

Right now birds “jump” positions each tick. Use Phaser’s tweens or Phaser.Math.Interpolation.SmoothStep to soften velocity changes.

Particle FX

Add feather/sparkle trails when cohesion is high.

Tiny dust puffs when birds skim close to ground/food sites.

Phaser’s particle emitter manager can handle thousands of lightweight particles.

Environmental Motion

Animated rivers (shader scrolling textures).

Swaying grass/trees on the map layers.

Subtle day–night gradient shifts.

Hazard VFX

Storms: add rotating debris layers, semi-transparent gradient overlays, lightning flashes with alpha tween.

Predators: give them shadow sprites, subtle motion blur, and screech sound effects tied to sprite scaling.

2. UI & Transitions
Panel animations: Instead of instant pop-ups, fade + slide UI panels.

Camera easing: Use smooth tweening when “framing flock” instead of jump cuts.

Cohesion meter glow: Use a shader overlay that pulses with the flock’s cohesion level.

3. Asset Upgrade
Commission or generate hand-painted 2D sprites and backgrounds matching your key art style.

Swap procedural placeholders (e.g., circles for hazards) for detoured illustrations (like we generated earlier).

4. Should You Change Tech?
If staying 2D: Phaser is fine. It supports WebGL, shaders, particles. Beauty will come from art direction and careful layering.

If wanting pseudo-3D:

PixiJS (lighter renderer with strong filter/shader support).

Unity WebGL export (heavier, but allows cinematic 2.5D flocks with lighting).

Trade-offs:

Unity/Unreal = richer visuals, but bigger build size, slower load, and harder web monetization.

Phaser = fast load, easy integration, but visuals depend on 2D artistry.

For a browser game with performance marketing, keeping Phaser and polishing visuals is safer. You want <10s load time, and Unity WebGL often pushes 20–30MB builds.

5. Concrete Next Steps
Add a 2-frame flap animation to birds.

Implement particle emitters for storm debris + predator trails.

Introduce day/night gradient shader in background.

Replace hazard placeholders with hand-drawn detoured assets.

Add UI tweening for panels and overlays.

Optimize with sprite batching and object pooling to keep 60 FPS.

👉 Recommendation: don’t change tech yet. Max out Phaser’s visual polish first. If, after that, you feel limited (e.g. you want cinematic camera sweeps, 3D lighting, volumetric clouds), then consider a Unity WebGL build.

Would you like me to draft sample Phaser code for (a) bird wing-flap animation and (b) a simple storm particle effect, so your team can drop it in right away?

You said:
Can you make unity games through visual studio?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can absolutely make Unity games using Visual Studio, but it’s important to clarify what each piece does:

1. Unity + Visual Studio Integration
Unity Editor is the actual game engine and IDE for building the game (scenes, prefabs, assets, etc.).

Visual Studio (VS) is the code editor & debugger Unity uses for C# scripts.

Unity comes with a Visual Studio Tools for Unity package — it links Unity to VS so you can:

Edit and auto-complete Unity’s C# API.

Attach the VS debugger to the Unity runtime.

Set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables live.

On install, Unity usually offers to install VS Community with this integration.

2. Workflow
Create a Unity project in the Unity Hub.

Unity generates a .sln (solution) file.

When you double-click a script in Unity, it opens in Visual Studio.

In VS:

You edit your C# scripts.

You can build, but usually you just save; Unity auto-compiles scripts.

Debugging is done by attaching VS to the Unity Editor process.

So: You don’t build Unity games inside Visual Studio — you build them in Unity, but you use VS as the IDE for code.

3. Alternatives
Instead of Visual Studio, you could use Rider, VS Code, or others.

But Visual Studio is the most complete, with built-in Unity integration and debugging support.

✅ Answer in one line:
Yes, you use Visual Studio to write and debug the C# scripts, but the actual game is built and run through the Unity Editor.

Would you like me to show you a step-by-step “Hello World” Unity + Visual Studio setup (with screenshots/code you’d see when you first connect the two)?

You said:
Are there game engines that can fully run in VS Code?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Short answer: no “full” game engine actually runs inside VS Code. VS Code is an editor. Engines are separate runtimes/editors—but many CLI-driven engines/frameworks let you do 100% of your workflow (edit, run, debug, build) from VS Code using tasks/launch configs.

Good options that work entirely from VS Code
Phaser / Three.js (TS/JS) — run in browser with Vite/Webpack dev server.

npm run dev → live reload; VS Code debugger attaches to Chrome.

Bevy (Rust) — pure code engine; run with Cargo.

cargo run / cargo build --release; VS Code Rust analyzer + debugger.

LÖVE (Lua) — launch via CLI.

love . (add a VS Code task); Love2D debugger extensions exist.

raylib (C/C++) — single-file to full games; build with CMake/Make.

VS Code C/C++ debugger configs for stepping through.

MonoGame (C#) — no separate scene editor required.

dotnet new mgdesktopgl && dotnet run; VS Code C# debugger.

Godot (C#/GDScript) — engine/editor is separate, but you can do headless runs/exports and use VS Code for script editing with extensions; still, the scene/prefab editing is in Godot.

Not “VS Code native”
Unity / Unreal / Cocos Creator / Defold — you write code in VS Code if you want, but you still use their own editors to build scenes and run the game.

Typical VS Code setups (examples)
Phaser (TypeScript)

npm create vite@latest murmuration --template vanilla-ts
cd murmuration && npm i phaser
npm run dev
VS Code: Debug → “Chrome: Launch” to attach; hot reload via Vite.

Bevy

cargo new murmuration_bevy
cd murmuration_bevy
cargo add bevy
cargo run
VS Code: Rust Analyzer + CodeLLDB for breakpoints.

LÖVE

.vscode/tasks.json task running love .; Ctrl+Shift+B to run.

Recommendation for Murmuration
Stay browser-based with Phaser and use VS Code + Vite (fast HMR, tiny builds for performance marketing). If you want richer visuals without leaving VS Code, consider Bevy (desktop/web via WASM) or raylib (C) — both are fully CLI-driven and play nicely with VS Code.

If you tell me your target (web vs desktop) and language preference, I’ll give you a ready-to-use VS Code workspace (tasks/launch configs) for the engine you pick.

i want to change the gameplay significantly. instead of just guiding the birds with beacons, i want to remove the beacon. and at the beginning of each level, for the user to draw the trajectory he wants the birds to follow. and the birds will do their best to follow it, but their characteristics should influence how they will be able to follow. cohesion, stress, speed, obstacles. the challenge then will be to draw the right trajectory to bring birds to destination without getting them killed. work on the step by step overhaul, be exhaustive
ChatGPT said:
Thanks. To provide an exhaustive step-by-step overhaul plan, could you confirm the following?

Should this new trajectory-drawing mechanic entirely replace the beacon system, or should both systems coexist in early levels for onboarding?

Do you want the user to draw the path in real time (while birds are flying), or only at the beginning of the level and then watch it play out?

Should the trajectory be a single path or can the user draw multiple branches or fallback paths?

Do you want visual feedback (like color change, line vibration) based on predicted stress, cohesion, or danger along the drawn path?

Once I have this info, I’ll provide the complete technical and gameplay overhaul plan.

You said:
1/ just drawing 2/ draw at the beginning . 3/ it can be a complex trajectory. 4/ no 5/ the bird characterstics must be thought through, and their influence on behavior. for instnace, stress increases fatigue speed. duration and length of path too. there could be new obstacles like head or tail wind, etc.

Got it. I’ll now prepare an exhaustive step-by-step overhaul plan for replacing the beacon system with a drawn-trajectory mechanic in Murmuration.

This will cover new gameplay logic, bird characteristic systems (e.g. stress, fatigue, speed, cohesion), trajectory interpretation, and new obstacle mechanics like wind. I’ll also account for technical changes needed in the current codebase and UX considerations for implementing this mechanic clearly and playably.

I’ll return with the full implementation roadmap shortly.

Overhaul Plan for Drawn-Trajectory Gameplay in Murmuration

Trajectory Drawing Gameplay Overhaul Plan
Step 1: Remove Beacon-Based Guidance
The first major change is eliminating the in-game beacon mechanic entirely. Originally, players would influence the flock by placing wind or attraction beacons during the flight or in a planning phase
GitHub
GitHub
. All beacon UI (e.g. beacon selection panel and placement controls) will be removed from the client. This means deleting or disabling code related to BeaconPanel and the pointerdown event that creates beacons (in GameScene.ts). The server-side beacon logic and BeaconManager can also be retired, as no wind-lure or cohesion boosters will be placed by the player anymore. Additionally, any genetic trait tied to beacons (e.g. beacon_sensitivity) should be dropped or repurposed, since birds will no longer be responding to player signals. By removing beacons, we shift the gameplay from reactive guiding to pure planning – the player’s only direct influence is drawing the path before the level starts.
Step 2: Introduce a Pre-Level Path Drawing Phase
We will add a new planning phase at the start of each level where the player draws a trajectory for the flock to follow. Instead of clicking to place beacons, the user can use the mouse (or touch) to draw a continuous path on the map from the start point to the destination. The game will likely pause at level start and prompt the player to “Draw your migration route.” During this phase, the game scene will capture pointer input to record a path:
Drawing Mechanics: The player can click and drag to draw a free-form line, or click multiple waypoints that auto-connect. We’ll render the path as a visible line on the map (using a Phaser Graphics object) so the player can see the planned route.
Start/End Constraints: The drawn path should begin near the flock’s start position and end at the level’s destination point. We can snap the first point to the flock’s spawn and require the last point to be at (or very close to) the goal. This ensures the path is complete from start to finish.
Editing: Provide a way to clear or redraw if the player is not satisfied (e.g. right-click to undo last point or a “Reset Path” button). The planning phase continues until the player confirms the path (perhaps a “Start Migration” button).
Budget/Length Feedback: We might show the path length or an estimated energy cost as the player draws, helping them judge if it’s too long. There is no strict “budget” on path length, but a very long route will consume more energy (increasing fatigue risk). A UI indicator (like a changing color or a length meter) can convey this.
Once the player finalizes the trajectory, that path is fixed and the level begins with the birds launching from the start along the drawn route.
Step 3: Support Complex Trajectories
The drawn path can be arbitrarily complex, allowing strategic detours. Unlike a simple straight-line, players can sketch curves, zig-zags, or multi-leg routes to avoid hazards and reach resources. The system will record the path as a series of waypoints or continuous curve points in world coordinates. Internally, we’ll store it as a polyline – an array of (x, y) positions that the flock should pass through in order. We must ensure the path data is synced to the simulation (e.g. sent to the server if the sim runs there) before the birds start moving. This complexity means the game must handle following any shape of route. Birds might need to turn multiple times along the path, so our path-following algorithm (discussed in the next step) should smoothly guide them through each bend. There is effectively no limit to how winding the path can be, but the key trade-off is that longer distances cost more energy
GitHub
. Taking a longer, safer route around a storm or mountain will drain endurance, potentially causing some birds to exhaust before reaching the end. Conversely, a short direct path might go through dangerous areas. This encourages players to draw efficient but safe trajectories. The level design can include multiple possible routes (e.g. a longer one that passes a food source vs. a straight one through a risk zone), and the drawn path system lets the player choose their strategy visually. To implement this, we’ll likely remove any old notion of pre-set waypoints and instead rely solely on the player’s drawn waypoints. The client should also visually indicate important map features during drawing – for example, show where food sources or hazards are, so the player can route around or through them wisely. Once a complex path is drawn, it remains displayed during the flight as an overlay (perhaps a faint line on the ground or a guiding arrow) to provide feedback on whether the flock is deviating from the intended course.
Step 4: Lock Path and Remove Mid-Flight Control
After the planning phase, when the level actually commences, the player can no longer alter the route or give new commands. No real-time interventions are allowed in this new design. This is a significant shift in gameplay: the player’s role is now entirely preparation and then observation. Once the birds are in the air, you must watch them attempt to follow the drawn path without the ability to drop beacons or redirect them on the fly. This adheres to the “influence-not-control” philosophy while raising the stakes on planning
GitHub
. All in-flight UI elements related to beacon placement or other signals will be removed or disabled. The only interactions during the flight might be passive ones like adjusting the camera or clicking a bird for info. Essentially, the game becomes “draw then hands-off”. If unforeseen events occur (e.g. a sudden predator spawn), the flock’s fate depends on the initial plan and their autonomous behaviors – the player cannot save them with a quick beacon anymore. This lack of mid-flight control means we must balance the game knowing the player can’t react in real time. Hazard appearances should be telegraphed (or deterministic per level) so that a well-drawn path accounts for them. Also, to keep players engaged, we might allow a speed toggle or pause during flight so they can observe or fast-forward, since their input isn’t needed until the next planning phase. In code, this step means simplifying the input system: once the game is unpaused to start the level, ignore clicks for beacon placement. The path drawn is the final instruction until the next level. We should thoroughly test that nothing in the simulation still expects beacon inputs (e.g. remove any default AI behavior that assumed a beacon might appear, and ensure the simulation doesn’t stall waiting for player input beyond the path).
Step 5: Implement Flock Path-Following Behavior
With a path in place, we need to modify the bird AI so that the flock will follow the drawn trajectory as closely as they can. This is a core technical challenge of the overhaul. In the current simulation, birds likely move based on boids flocking rules (cohesion, separation, alignment) and simple goal-seeking or beacon influences. We will introduce a new steering component: path following. How it works: At any given time, each bird (or the flock as a whole) will have a target point on the drawn path that it’s trying to reach. A straightforward approach is to break the path into sequential waypoints: the flock aims for the first waypoint; once a majority of birds reach it (or come within a certain radius), the target switches to the next waypoint, and so on until the destination. This provides a stepwise guide through the route. We’ll integrate this with the boid mechanics:
Each bird’s desired direction will be influenced by the vector toward the current path target. This is analogous to how a beacon’s wind might have pulled them before, but now it’s a pull toward the next path point.
We will weight this path-following force alongside the standard flocking forces. For example, if a bird is far off the drawn line, the path force will steer it back toward the path. If it’s roughly on track, the force is smaller, allowing natural flocking behavior to continue. The path thus acts like an invisible guide that the birds prefer to stick to.
A more continuous technique is to have each bird find the nearest point on the path ahead of it and steer toward a point slightly further along from that (a lookahead point). This helps them follow curves smoothly without overshooting. We can implement this by computing the projection of the bird’s position onto the path polyline and then taking a point a fixed distance ahead on the path for it to seek.
It’s important that path following does not make the birds fly in lockstep like on rails – they should still maintain separation (not all cram on the exact line) and cohesion. We might allow some lateral spacing around the drawn line so the formation has area to maneuver. If the path has a sharp turn, not all birds will hit the exact same spot; some might take a slightly wider turn, but as long as they then converge back toward the next segment, that’s fine. The algorithm might consider the flock’s center of mass relative to the path as well, steering the group toward the path collectively. On the server/simulation side, we will likely update the agent update loop to include something like steer_toward(path_target) in each bird’s behavior, combined with their existing velocity and neighbor avoidance. We also need to consider path termination: once the birds reach the final destination point, they should stop or land (end of level logic), which likely already exists when birds enter the destination zone.
Step 6: Account for Bird Traits and New Obstacles
With the new path-following mechanic in place, we must consider how different bird characteristics affect their ability to follow the path and survive the journey. The game already simulates various traits; we’ll ensure they have meaningful influence in the path-drawing context:
Flock Cohesion Trait: Birds with high cohesion tendency will stick closer together when following the path, whereas low-cohesion birds may stray further from the group. This means if the flock gets spread out along a long curve or after avoiding an obstacle, high-cohesion birds will regroup more quickly. In gameplay terms, a tight cohesive flock is easier to keep on the drawn route (they behave like a single unit), while a low cohesion flock might see some individuals cutting corners or wandering off, possibly into danger. We should continue to use the cohesion behavior weights to maintain grouping around the path line.
Stress and Fatigue: We will introduce a link between stress levels and fatigue (energy burn). If birds become highly stressed (e.g. due to nearby predators or turbulence), they will tire faster – essentially increasing their energy consumption rate when stress is high. For example, a panicked bird might flap harder or waste energy, causing its endurance to drop quicker than a calm bird. We can implement this by scaling the energy drain: when a bird’s stress is above a threshold, apply a multiplier to its fatigue rate (so high stress =, say, +20% energy drain). This makes stressful situations (tight evasive maneuvers, predator chases) more costly in terms of stamina, aligning with the user’s note that stress increases fatigue speed. Birds with the stress_resilience trait will be less affected by this – their stress level rises more slowly or has less impact on fatigue. In effect, a resilient bird can keep a cooler head and not exhaust itself as quickly under pressure.
Endurance (Energy Efficiency): This trait determines how far a bird can travel on a full tank of energy. In the context of drawn paths, endurance is crucial for long or roundabout trajectories. A bird with higher energy efficiency will lose energy more slowly per distance traveled
GitHub
, allowing it to survive a longer path or a headwind section that others might not. When the player draws a path that pushes the limits of distance (say, going out-of-the-way to avoid all hazards), birds with low endurance may start dropping out (dying of exhaustion) before reaching the goal. This encourages players to consider path length carefully and perhaps include stops at food sources if available. We will use the existing energy mechanics (distance-based energy depletion) which already ensure longer paths consume more energy, and we’ll double-check it’s tuned so that most birds can make it if the player chooses an optimal route. We might also visualize the expected energy usage of the route in the planning phase (maybe a bar showing “this path will use ~80% of average energy” based on distance).
Speed Variation: Not all birds fly at exactly the same speed – there is a speed_factor trait that gives some variation. In path following, faster birds might move ahead along the path while slower ones lag. This can stretch out the flock, potentially reducing cohesion. If a few speedy leaders get too far ahead, they might even veer off path if they overshoot a turn before the slower birds catch up. To address this, we might cap the leading birds’ speed a bit when the flock is strung out (encourage them to slow down if far from the flock centroid). Conversely, slower birds with low speed_factor might struggle to keep up, especially if the path involves fighting wind or requires bursts of speed to escape hazards. The player can’t directly manage speeds, but they should be aware (via bird stats) that some birds simply might not keep up on a very aggressive route. This trait will create scenarios where, for instance, your fastest bird might always be at the front (and possibly first to encounter danger), whereas the slowest might be at risk of falling behind during long path segments.
Leadership Trait: If the simulation includes a leadership or flock influence trait, this becomes interesting in path following. A bird with high leadership tendency could inadvertently become a path guide or misguide. For example, if a leader deviates from the path (perhaps to skirt a hazard it personally wants to avoid), others might follow that bird instead of the drawn line. On the positive side, a leader that sticks to the path will help pull the flock along it, acting almost like an anchor to the planned route. We might simulate this by giving high-leadership birds a stronger pull toward the path target (so they effectively go first and others follow), or by weighting the cohesion/alignment so that neighbors follow leaders
GitHub
. This way, a strong leader can keep the flock on course, whereas in a flock with no clear leaders, you might get more diffusion around the path. Tuning this will be important so that the player’s path is still the primary guidance – leadership should modulate how tightly they adhere, not completely override the plan.
Hazard Awareness: Some birds are inherently better at detecting and avoiding hazards (predators, storms) courtesy of the hazard_awareness trait
GitHub
. These differences will play out when the path intersects or comes near a danger. A high-awareness bird might start to veer away from a storm even if the drawn path goes through it, because it “sees” the threat sooner. This could cause a temporary split – the wiser birds break formation to avoid the hazard, while lower-awareness birds blunder onward along the line and possibly into trouble. In design, this means even a well-drawn path through a hazard zone might not be followed perfectly by all: some will intelligently deviate (which could save their lives), but it might reduce cohesion. We should allow birds to deviate from the path for self-preservation if a hazard is immediately threatening. The path-following force would momentarily yield to hazard avoidance behavior. Once clear of the hazard, those birds could navigate back to the drawn route (perhaps rejoin at a later waypoint). From the player’s perspective, a bird with high awareness might survive a poor route choice (it flies around the storm the player drew through), whereas a low-awareness bird would trust the path too much and perish. This adds depth: the flock’s genetic makeup can forgive or punish the player’s route decisions.
Environmental Winds (Headwind/Tailwind): We will introduce wind as a significant environmental factor that the player must account for in their path. The game already has a wind field in the environment
GitHub
, but now we will emphasize persistent wind directions as “invisible obstacles.” A headwind (wind blowing against the flock’s direction of travel) will slow the birds’ ground speed and make them expend more energy to make progress. If the player draws a path straight into a strong headwind, the flock might crawl forward and many could run out of energy before the next rest, or be unable to outrun predators. Conversely, a tailwind (wind from behind) gives the birds a boost – they travel faster with less effort. We can simulate this by projecting the wind vector onto the birds’ velocity: when wind is aligned opposite to movement, add an effective drag or increase energy drain; with a tailwind, grant a speed increase or reduce energy cost. This was conceptually present in the original design via the Wind Lure beacon that boosted tailwinds
GitHub
, but now it will be part of the static environment rather than a player tool. We might display a wind indicator on the UI (like an arrow on the map or in a mini-map) so the player knows the prevailing wind direction and can draw the route accordingly (for example, maybe zig-zag to avoid long stretches of headwind, or go a bit out of the way to catch a tailwind corridor). Wind can also be spatially varied: perhaps certain map areas have stronger winds (like mountain passes or open ocean segments). These become natural obstacles — e.g., a corridor of headwind that the player might decide to circumvent by drawing a curved path around it, at the cost of distance.
Other Obstacles and Effects: Apart from wind, other hazards like storms and predators remain in play. As noted, flying through a storm could drastically increase fatigue (in current code, storms already cause rapid energy loss and can even kill birds with lightning
GitHub
). Our path system will likely encourage players to avoid storms entirely by drawing around them. If they don’t, expect heavy casualties or energy drain while inside the storm. We should make sure storm effects (increased stress, random course deviation, energy drain) are still functioning and perhaps amplify them to strongly discourage straight-lining through a storm. Predators (like a hawk that might attack the flock) will cause stress spikes and flock dispersion if encountered. Under the new system, players can’t divert on the fly, so if a predator is known to appear from a certain area, the drawn path should avoid that area or pass it when the predator isn’t around. It might be worth introducing some predictability or clues (e.g., “falcon nests here”) so players can plan paths that minimize exposure. If a predator does attack, birds will scatter or dodge on their own (which could pull them off the path briefly). Once safe, they should regroup and return toward the path on their own.
Finally, with all these factors considered, we will need to playtest and balance the new system. The lack of mid-flight control means if many birds are dying consistently, we may need to adjust parameters (e.g. make wind a bit less brutal or reduce hazard frequency) to give the player a fair chance through planning alone. We’ll also update tutorials and tooltips: instead of teaching beacon placement, the game should teach drawing effective paths (perhaps a training level where the optimal path is shown). The result of this overhaul is a more planning-centric, strategic experience: the player sketches a path, and the simulation of the flock’s behavior, influenced by their traits and the environment, determines the outcome
GitHub
GitHub
. It’s a significant shift, but if executed well, it will make Murmuration a unique strategy game where the challenge is to draw the perfect migration route and then trust your birds to follow it as nature and fate take their course.

now think of how we can, in the architecture, create a level design and progression module, that can have it's own intelligent rules to create hundreds of levels, not of progressive difficulty, but of similar difficulty that we can adjust. we want to be able to set the average number of attempts players need to succeed and tweak difficulty accordingly automatically . so the module should both do automated level design, and level balancing with complex rules. document yourself on the web, and then figure out what to change and what to build to make this happen. we will keep the migration/leg structure.

To design the level progression and automated generation module with intelligent difficulty balancing, I’ll need to clarify a few points first:

What specific difficulty elements should the generator be able to manipulate? (e.g., terrain complexity, obstacle density, wind direction, predator spawn, food scarcity)

How granular should the control over difficulty be? Are we aiming for a single numeric "difficulty rating" per level, or a multidimensional profile?

Should the system adapt difficulty in real time based on aggregate player data (e.g., success rates), or will it use predefined simulation metrics?

Should we support different level "themes" (e.g., mountain vs. ocean vs. desert migrations) with distinct level generation rules?

Should this system be implemented server-side, client-side, or shared as a utility module for both?

Could you please clarify these points so I can proceed with a detailed architecture and research plan?

Server-Side Intelligent Level Generation and Balancing System for Murmuration

Intelligent Level Design & Progression Module Architecture
Goal: Consistent Difficulty with Adjustable Challenge
We need a procedural level generation system that can create hundreds of levels (around 100 legs across ~10 migrations) with consistent, tunable difficulty. Rather than a linear difficulty ramp, each level should hover around a target difficulty, adjustable so that on average players require a certain number of attempts to succeed. This keeps gameplay challenging but fair, avoiding steep difficulty spikes or drops. The system will allow developers to set an average success rate (e.g. target ~60–80% first-try completion
GitHub
) corresponding to the desired attempts per success, and automatically tweak level parameters to achieve that. Ultimately, this ensures players neither breeze through all levels (too easy) nor get frustrated by repeated failures (too hard), maintaining the fun “flow” zone
pcgworkshop.com
.
Procedural Level Generation Rules
To generate rich and varied migration legs, the module will use rule-based procedural content generation. Each level (leg) is defined by a set of environmental elements, all of which affect difficulty:
Obstacle Layout & Density: Place physical obstacles (e.g. mountains or barriers) that birds must navigate around. We will introduce impassable terrain like mountains (new obstacle type) that force path detours. The generator must ensure these aren’t placed so as to completely block progress – at least one viable corridor should remain open.
Hazards (Storms & Wind): Generate hazardous weather like storms or strong wind zones. We’ll specify wind fields (areas with wind direction and intensity) that can impede or aid the flock. For instance, a headwind region increases difficulty (slows birds, higher energy burn), while a tailwind might ease travel. Storms could be treated as moving hazards that drain energy or disorient birds.
Predators: Spawn a certain number of predator entities with defined locations/patrol areas. Predators increase difficulty by chasing and potentially killing birds. The module might allow multiple predators per level as difficulty rises (e.g. later levels having 2–3 predators). Each predator’s speed, range, and kill chance can be tuned.
Food Sources: Position food/nectar sites at strategic locations. These are safe havens where birds can refuel energy. Proper placement of food is critical – typically a level should require at least one feeding stop (so the direct start-to-finish path exceeds birds’ endurance). The generator will ensure that food sources are reachable (not all guarded by hazards) so that an attentive player can guide the flock to refuel. Placing food roughly midway or at 50–60% of leg distance is a common rule, forcing a detour for survival
GitHub
.
Wind Direction and Intensity: For added variety, define global or regional wind patterns each leg. A crosswind or headwind can act as an “invisible obstacle,” while a tailwind eases travel. Wind regions will be part of the level config (e.g. a vector field applied in an area
GitHub
). This allows thematic scenarios like a windy mountain pass or calm coastal breeze.
Level Geometry (Start/End Points): Each leg has start and end checkpoints (e.g. A→B). We preserve the migration/leg structure of sequential checkpoints. The generator can either use fixed coordinate templates or randomly choose start/end positions within the world bounds (ensuring the distance is within a target range). For consistency, we likely keep the total migration distance similar across themes, and legs of moderate length (so that one or two food stops are needed per leg).
Generation Algorithm: We will implement a content generator that uses a difficulty budget to add these elements to a level. For each leg, the system assigns a hazard budget or difficulty score and populates the level with obstacles until that budget is filled
GitHub
. For example, a storm might “cost” 3 difficulty points and a predator 5 points; an easier level might get ~5 points total (maybe one storm and some wind), whereas a harder one might get 10+ points (multiple hazards). By tuning this budget we control overall difficulty in a transparent way. Alongside this, fairness rules ensure playability – e.g. guarantee at least one safe (or safer) route from start to finish despite the hazards
GitHub
. This may involve spacing hazards so their danger zones don’t fully overlap, or placing gaps in a mountain range, etc. Example: A mid-difficulty leg might be generated with a budget of 8 points: the rules could spawn 1 storm (3 pts) in the center, 1 predator (5 pts) near the end checkpoint. A couple of impassable mountains might border the direct path, forcing the flock to detour toward a food site placed off-center. Strong headwinds could be added on the direct route (to discourage it) but a calmer corridor exists along the detour. The result is a unique level layout that still abides by the difficulty target. Critically, once a level is generated it remains fixed for all players and attempts – no randomization each try. We’ll seed the procedural generator with a fixed seed per level (for instance based on the leg/migration ID) so that the layout is deterministic
GitHub
. This way, if a player fails and retries, they see the same configuration and can learn and improve (making multiple attempts meaningful rather than luck-based). It also means we can iteratively adjust or regenerate a level and roll it out in an update, and all players will experience the updated design. (The level definitions can be stored in a JSON or database and only changed when we deliberately run the generator again with new parameters
GitHub
.)
Difficulty Measurement & Target Tuning
To make “adjustable difficulty” concrete, we need a way to measure each level’s difficulty and compare it to the target. Our primary metric will be the average number of attempts to succeed (or inversely, the success rate on first attempt). For example, if we want players to succeed in ~3 tries on average, that corresponds to roughly a 30–40% first-try success rate. Initially, we can set an approximate target like “70% of players succeed on the first attempt” (which implies most others succeed on the second)
GitHub
. This keeps the challenge high enough that failure is common, but not so high that players give up en masse. Estimating Difficulty: Before we have player data, the module can use a heuristic difficulty model. This could be as simple as summing the hazard budget points or using a formula that weighs various level parameters (e.g. number of predators, storm strength, distance between food sites, etc.). For instance, one could estimate expected survival rate based on energy required vs food provided, plus risk factors from hazards. During development and internal testing, we might simulate the flock’s journey (with a baseline “average” player strategy) to see how many birds survive or how often they fail. This can help calibrate the initial difficulty budgets. In fact, internal balance guidelines already suggest aiming for about 60–80% completion rate on a first run
GitHub
, which aligns with our plan. Tuning Process: Once the game is live and real players attempt the levels, we gather telemetry: how many attempts each level takes per player, where do birds die, etc. Using this data, the difficulty module can adjust levels after the fact. If a particular leg turns out much harder than intended (say only 20% succeed on first try, meaning many need 4–5 attempts), the system can respond by dialing down difficulty for that leg. This might mean reducing the hazard budget or altering specific elements (e.g. smaller storm radius, adding an extra food spot, removing one predator). Conversely, if a level is too easy (90%+ first-try success), it could be toughened (add an extra hazard or increase wind resistance). The key is these adjustments are done in batches (offline), not on the fly for each attempt – preserving fairness and preventing “adaptive difficulty” from negating player mastery. We should design a difficulty index for each level that is updated based on player outcomes. For example, an index could be the average attempts or a rating derived from success rate (e.g. 0.7 first-try success = difficulty 0.3 on a 0–1 scale). The module’s goal is to keep all levels’ difficulty index near the chosen target value. Small variance is fine (to keep things interesting and allow some levels to feel slightly easier or harder), but overall they cluster around the set point (i.e. no progressive ramp, just a narrow band of difficulty). This way, the entire collection of levels feels consistent, and players can expect a similar level of challenge throughout, instead of, say, a trivial first level and an impossible last level.
Machine Learning for Adaptive Level Balancing
In the long term, the level design module should incorporate machine learning to refine both level generation and difficulty evaluation. This would make the system “intelligent” in adjusting content. A possible approach is Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation, where a model of player experience (in our case, difficulty/attempts) guides the content creation
julian.togelius.com
. Concretely, we could develop a predictive model that learns the relationship between level parameters and player performance. For example, a regression model or even a small neural network could take inputs like “number of obstacles, total hazard area, average wind speed against player, distance between food, number of predators, etc.” and output a predicted success rate or expected attempts. We would train this model on actual data collected from players playing different generated levels (or on simulation data augmented with test sessions). Over time, the model will learn which combinations of factors make a level harder or easier. This is akin to the approach in Polymorph, a research system that used machine learning to understand how level components contribute to difficulty and to tailor levels to the player
pcgworkshop.com
. In our case, instead of tailoring to each player in real-time, we tailor the difficulty to the desired average player experience across the board. With an ML model in place, the generation process can become smarter: rather than blindly assigning a hazard budget, the generator could iteratively tweak the level (or sample many candidate levels) and use the model to predict their difficulty, picking the one closest to target. This adds an AI-driven feedback loop to content creation. It’s not real-time for the player, but it is an automated way to achieve balance. Essentially, the system tunes itself using accumulated knowledge of what makes players struggle or succeed. Another advantage of ML is capturing complex interactions between elements. The difficulty of a level isn’t just the sum of its parts – it could be the synergy of a windstorm blowing birds into a predator zone that makes it especially lethal. A learning model can infer such nonlinear effects (as noted in research, difficulty can arise from interactions of level components
pcgworkshop.com
). Our model might discover, for instance, that “a predator placed immediately after a long stretch with headwind and no food” causes an outsized spike in failures – something we can then adjust in generation rules (e.g. avoid that combination or flag it as an extreme difficulty pattern). In implementation terms, this ML component could be developed and run server-side. Initially, we might start with simple data analytics (calculating averages and adjusting parameters via formula). As data grows, we could train a model offline and then deploy it into the server so that the next batch of level adjustments uses the model’s predictions. Over time, the system’s difficulty estimates become more accurate, and manual guesswork is reduced. The result is a relative difficulty indicator for each level that is grounded in real player behavior, not just designer intuition. This aligns with the goal of having the module eventually be ML-driven, learning from how players play to keep difficulty within the ideal range.
Offline Batch Difficulty Adjustment
Because we do not adjust difficulty in real-time per individual player, the system will operate in a batch mode triggered by an operator (e.g. a live ops designer or an automated nightly job). Here’s how a typical cycle might work:
Data Collection: As players play through the migrations, the server records relevant stats: attempts per leg, success/failure counts, average survivors, etc. This data is aggregated over time (for example, over a week or a certain number of players).
Difficulty Analysis: The module (or a data analyst) reviews the stats to identify which levels are off-target. This could be automated – e.g. compute the average attempts for each leg and compare to the goal. The output might be something like: Leg 3 of Migration 2 has 4.5 attempts average (too hard), Leg 7 of Migration 5 has 1.2 attempts average (too easy), others are ~2–3 attempts (on target).
Adjustment Planning: For each outlier level, the system decides what adjustments to make. This is where our complex rule set comes into play – it’s not just scaling a number but possibly regenerating part of the level. For example:
If a level is too hard: reduce obstacle density or hazard intensity (e.g. remove one predator or shorten the storm duration), or add an extra food site to give players more margin.
If a level is too easy: introduce an additional hazard or increase an existing one’s impact (e.g. more wind force or a secondary predator spawn), or slightly reduce available resources.
All adjustments still obey the core rules (ensuring the level remains fair and not uncompletable). We might also enforce that adjustments are moderate to avoid swinging difficulty too much in one update (small tweaks lead to small variations around the average difficulty, as desired).
Batch Update: An operator triggers the generation module to apply these changes. This could mean running a script that regenerates the affected levels with new random seeds or parameters, or directly tweaking the saved level JSON configurations. Because this is server-side, the new level definitions are then used for all subsequent play sessions (players might see a level’s hazard layout slightly change after an update, which is acceptable in a living game as long as it’s communicated or subtle).
Verification: The updated levels can be tested internally (or A/B tested with a subset of players) to verify the difficulty has moved in the intended direction
GitHub
. Over multiple such batches, the levels should converge to the target difficulty band.
One important aspect: not by the player in real time means we do not do things like rubber-banding difficulty during a single run or altering a level on a per-player basis. Every player who attempts Migration 3, Leg 2 this week will face the same challenge. Only when the devs decide to recalibrate (based on broad data) will that leg get a one-time adjustment for everyone. This ensures transparency and that players can discuss strategies knowing the level is the same for all (and if they retry, the level doesn’t suddenly get easier just because they failed – that could feel patronizing or defeat the purpose of learning). Our adjustments happen behind-the-scenes between gameplay sessions, much like how an AI director might offline adjust scenarios for the next game iteration rather than during the current game. By keeping this process manual-triggered, we also allow a human in the loop. The designers can review the generator’s suggestions or the ML model’s outputs and veto or refine them if needed, maintaining creative control. The complexity of the rules (considering how obstacle placement, wind, predators interact) benefits from human oversight, especially in early tuning. Over time, as confidence in the system grows, it could become more automated.
Multiple Migrations & Thematic Variations
We plan to produce 10 distinct migrations (worlds/themes), with about 100 legs total (averaging 10 legs per migration). The level design module will support generating content for each migration theme, reusing the same underlying logic but with different flavor and slight rule variations to keep the game interesting. For example, some thematic ideas for migrations and how the generator might adapt:
Coastal Migration: Open water and islands theme. More wind gusts (sea breezes), fewer mountains (open sky), predators might be eagles or gulls that attack over water. Food sites could be small islands or coastal wetlands. The generator for this theme would place fewer impassable obstacles but might include strong winds and storms at sea.
Mountain Passage: Lots of impassable terrain (mountain ranges) creating narrow passes. Wind might be updrafts or downdrafts in valleys. Predators could be hawks that strike in valleys. Here the generator uses more mountain obstacles and ensures that the checkpoint path snakes through them. Hazard budget might skew towards terrain and less towards storms.
Desert Crossing: Hot dry theme. Possibly persistent headwind (simulating hot air currents) and few but critical oases for food. Storms could be dust storms (reducing visibility). Predators might be scarce (open desert has fewer hawks), so difficulty comes from long distance and wind. Generator ensures distance between food is at the limit of endurance to force careful planning.
Arctic Tundra: Cold stormy theme. Frequent storms (blizzards), strong winds, and maybe wide open terrain with occasional mountains (glaciers). Predators could be arctic foxes or falcons. Food might be scarce but perhaps larger effect (e.g. a big feeding ground midway). The generator here would allocate more storms and wind chill hazards.
(...other themes as needed to reach 10 migrations, e.g. jungle, wetland, urban migration with city lights as hazards, etc.)
Each migration will have a unique level palette but the difficulty will remain consistent. That means Migration 5 isn’t necessarily harder than Migration 2; they are different in feel but designed to the same average success rate. This contrasts with the original idea of progressive worlds, and instead treats all migrations as parallel challenges under a unifying difficulty setting. We may, however, introduce slight progression or gating in terms of unlocking migrations – for example, require completing one migration to unlock the next. But that’s more a content unlocking decision; the difficulty difference between them would be minor. The player’s flock might improve genetically after each migration (making them a bit stronger), and since the levels don’t dramatically ramp up, the player feels a sense of mastery growth without hitting a wall. In essence, the flock’s improved abilities help offset any tiny difficulty increments, keeping the required attempts roughly stable. From an architecture perspective, we will likely extend the MigrationManager and level data structures to handle more legs and dynamic generation. Instead of four fixed legs (A→B→C→D→Z), we allow an arbitrary number of legs per journey. Checkpoints can be labeled alphabetically or numerically (we might programmatically label checkpoints A, B, C... etc., up to J or K for 10+ legs). We will write code to generate a migration given a theme specification: it would create the checkpoints (positions) and then for each adjacent pair of checkpoints, generate the leg’s hazard/obstacle layout according to that theme’s rules and difficulty target. These generated migrations can be stored in MigrationManager.available_journeys with keys like “coastal_run”, “mountain_passage”, etc., or even generated on the fly when a player starts a new campaign. Since the generation is deterministic (based on seeds), we could either pre-generate all 10 migrations at server startup and keep them constant, or generate them once and cache the results (or save to a levels.json).
Server-Side Implementation & Required Changes
To realize this system, several changes and new components are needed in the architecture:
Level Generator Module: We will build a new server-side module (e.g. level_generator.py) responsible for creating level configurations. This module encapsulates the rules for obstacle placement, hazard budgeting, and theming. It might expose a function like generate_leg(theme, difficulty_target, seed) -> LevelConfig which produces the hazard list, wind zones, food locations, etc., for one leg. Internally it will use random number generation (seeded for reproducibility) and the rule constraints described. We can leverage the existing level JSON structure by populating it with generated values
GitHub
, so that the rest of the simulation code (which reads GameConfig.level_hazards etc.) remains compatible. Essentially, instead of hand-authored levels.json entries, we programmatically fill those entries.
Integration with MigrationManager: The MigrationManager._load_journey_templates() will be updated to use the Level Generator. Rather than hardcoding legs with a level_template string, we will call the generator for each leg. For example, when creating Migration “spring_coastal”, the code would determine how many legs it should have (perhaps 8–10) and loop to generate each one. Checkpoint coordinates can be set in a line from start to finish (maybe with some randomness or based on theme geography). Each leg’s difficulty target will be roughly the same; any slight variation could be decided (e.g. maybe later legs in the same migration get +10% difficulty to account for player’s improving flock, but that’s optional and would be small). The MigrationLeg objects will be filled with the generated hazards, food sites, etc., possibly by storing them in MigrationLeg.hazards (the dataclass already has a field for hazards and food_sites
GitHub
). This might require extending the MigrationLeg to hold wind or terrain info too, or we treat terrain as a type of hazard.
Data Tracking: We need to implement logging of attempt counts and success for each level. The server can increment counters each time a leg is started and when it’s successfully finished or failed. This could be as simple as writing to a file or database table with level ID and outcome. We might create a DifficultyTracker class that aggregates this info and computes the metrics per level after enough data has been collected.
Difficulty Adjustment Tool: A script or admin interface should be created to trigger re-balancing. This tool would load the latest stats (perhaps from a database or logs), highlight levels that are off target, and then call the generation module with adjusted parameters for those levels. For example, it might call generate_leg(theme="mountain", difficulty_target=0.5, seed=X) with a slightly lower target if the level was too hard (effectively regenerating a slightly easier version of that leg). The output would replace the old level configuration. This could be automated to run periodically, but given the instruction, we’ll keep it operator-triggered to allow oversight.
Testing & Iteration: We will incorporate testing for the new system. Unit tests can verify that generation rules produce valid levels (e.g. no unreachable end, hazards within expected ranges). Simulation tests could run an automated flock through generated levels to get an estimate of survival, ensuring it roughly matches the target before releasing the level. Over time, as the ML model gets integrated, we’d also test that the model’s predictions align with actual outcomes (continuously improving the model).
Server Performance: Generating 100 levels is not very heavy (mostly random number crunching and simple spatial checks), so doing it at server startup or on demand is fine. The ML difficulty prediction, if used, would also be lightweight (a small model evaluation). This all stays on the server. Clients will simply receive the level data (hazards, etc.) as they do now, via the WebSocket state updates, unaware of how it was generated. Since it’s server-side, we maintain control and can update generation logic without forcing client updates (unless new asset types like a mountain sprite need to be added – but we anticipate adding mountain obstacle graphics as part of the content update).
In summary, we will replace the static level content with a smart level generation system that uses rule-based PCG (and later ML-enhanced PCG) to create many levels of controlled difficulty. All the heavy lifting – designing level layouts, evaluating difficulty, adjusting balance – happens on the server side in batch operations. By keeping difficulty consistent and auto-tuned to a target (using player data feedback), we ensure that the game remains engaging: players will usually take a couple of tries to beat a level, which indicates challenge, but almost never an extreme number of tries, which prevents frustration. This approach follows industry best practices of dynamic difficulty adjustment through content generation (as seen in research like Polymorph, which aimed to keep players in the sweet spot of difficulty by altering level design on the fly
pcgworkshop.com
). Here, we apply those principles in a controlled, offline manner suitable for our multi-session strategic game. The end result will be a Level Design & Progression module that can automatically produce a large library of balanced levels, adapt those levels based on real-world play patterns, and support various thematic journeys – all while maintaining the migration/leg structure that ties the gameplay together.

To produce the most accurate and thorough roadmap, could you please confirm a few key points:

Should I focus only on the current state of the main branch on GitHub (BenPomme/murmuration), or should I also include older branches or experimental features?

Do you want the report to only include bugs and mismatches compared to game_rules.md and our recent design discussion, or should it also include suggestions for improved game design/UX beyond what was previously discussed?

Should I treat visual fidelity (camera, clarity, resolution) as top-priority equal to gameplay bugs?

Once confirmed, I’ll start a full structured audit and roadmap based on what’s live in the repo.

Complete Audit and Fix Roadmap for Murmuration Main Branch

Phase 1 – Fix Core Gameplay Flow (Highest Priority)
1. Enable the Pre-Level Planning Phase (Trajectory Drawing): Currently, after the “Start Level” button is clicked, the game unpauses immediately and birds launch before any path is drawn
GitHub
. This breaks the intended planning phase described in our design. To fix this, we must trigger the path-drawing mode instead of immediately resuming the simulation. In practice:
Stop auto-resume on Start Level: Remove or disable the wsClient.resumeGame() call on the startLevel event
GitHub
. Instead, initiate planning mode by calling GameScene.startPlanningPhase(). This will pause the simulation and allow path drawing (it already emits a togglePause to pause and sets isPlanningPhase=true
GitHub
).
Show the planning UI: The startPlanningPhase() method in GameScene already signals the UI scene to show the planning panel
GitHub
GitHub
. Ensure that event is fired. After clicking “Start Level”, the player should see the “Plan Your Route” panel with drawing instructions, and the game remains paused. This aligns with the design where the player draws the trajectory before flight
GitHub
.
2. Hide Planning Panel During Drawing: Currently, the instruction panel stays on screen while drawing, obstructing the view (“the panel in the middle does not disappear to let him draw”). To improve UX, auto-hide it on first draw action. For example, in the pointerdown handler for drawing, once we detect a left-click in planning mode (i.e. user starts drawing), call UIScene.hidePlanningPanel() to close the overlay. This can be added in GameScene.startPathDrawing() or right inside the pointerdown event before starting the path. The planning panel is already a Phaser Container; we just need to set it invisible when drawing begins. The UI scene’s hidePlanningPanel will also restore other HUD panels
GitHub
. 3. Prevent Starting Flight Without a Drawn Path: As it stands, the player can hit “Start Migration” with no path drawn, causing the flock to fly aimlessly at spawn. We should disable or guard the Start Migration button until a valid path is drawn. For instance, keep the “Start Migration” button non-interactive (greyed out) initially, and enable it when drawnPath length > 0. A quick solution is to check in UIScene.startMigration() (the handler for that button) if the path is empty and, if so, refuse to proceed (possibly show a message like “Draw a path first!”). This prevents launching the level without guidance. The code already only sends the path if one exists
GitHub
, but we need to also stay in planning mode if drawnPath is empty (do not emit startMigration or call endPlanningPhase). In summary: don’t call GameScene.endPlanningPhase() unless a path exists. 4. Ensure Path Starts/Ends at Correct Points: To make bird behavior match the rules, enforce the path start/end constraints described in our design (path should begin near the flock and end at the destination). We can implement simple checks when the player finishes drawing (in finishPathDrawing()): if the first waypoint is too far from the flock’s start position, consider prepending a point at the flock’s start. Likewise, if the last waypoint is not within the destination radius, automatically append the destination as the final point. This ensures the drawn route is complete. (At minimum, warn or prevent the Start button if the path doesn’t reach the goal.) These tweaks guarantee the flock actually has a route from A to B as intended, rather than stopping short. 5. Fix Game Restart on Loss: When the player loses (all birds die), the “Retry Level” button currently does nothing – the game stays stuck because we never reset the simulation. To fix this, wire the Retry flow to actually reload the level. The simplest approach: on “Retry Level” click (which triggers the startLevel event with the panel text “RETRY”
GitHub
), instead of resuming a nonexistent game, call our level-load function to start a fresh simulation. For example, in the startLevel handler, detect if it was a retry (we could set a flag when showing the failure panel) and invoke wsClient.loadLevel(0) or the appropriate level index. In practice, since a total wipeout ends the migration, we likely restart from the first leg with a new flock. Calling start_unified (via wsClient.loadLevel(0)) will create a new PathSimulation on the server
GitHub
 and send a fresh level_loaded for leg 1. The UI will show the Level 1 panel again and allow planning. This ensures the game can be played again without a full page refresh. 6. Sequence Testing: After implementing the above, test the full flow: Start Game → Level intro panel → Start Level (should enter planning mode, not unpause) → draw path → Start Migration (should send path and unpause simulation) → play through level → if fail, Retry (should reload level state and show intro panel again) → if succeed, Continue (next leg). This sequence should now match the intended smooth experience, with no “broken” clicks or dead buttons.
Phase 2 – Fix Bird Movement & Simulation Behavior
7. Enforce Birds Follow the Drawn Path to Completion: In the current build, many birds are not actually following the trajectory all the way, especially if leaders die or stray. One major cause is that only the designated leader birds (5 of them) are influenced by the drawn path – the rest just flock among themselves
GitHub
. If those few leaders perish early or diverge, the remaining flock has no path guidance. To address this, we should make all birds at least weakly follow the path waypoints (not just leaders). A straightforward fix is to call the path-following logic for every bird each tick, albeit with different strength for leaders vs followers. For example, remove the condition so that _follow_path() applies to all agents, and inside it use a smaller path_strength for non-leaders. Concretely, in PathSimulation.step(), after computing boid forces, add something like: if path exists: agent.velocity += (path_direction * k) for all birds. You can achieve this by moving the if self.is_leader check inside _follow_path or by looping through all agents with _follow_path unconditionally (adjusting force based on role). This change will ensure even “follower” birds stay on course behind the leaders. The result should be a much tighter adherence to the drawn trajectory by the entire flock, as originally described in game_rules. It aligns with the intended behavior that the flock “maintains separation and cohesion but prefers to stick to the planned route”
GitHub
. 8. Cap Extreme Bird Speeds and Jittery Movement: Right now, as observed, a large portion of the flock sometimes “fly at 10x speed into the top-left corner.” This is likely due to an absence of a velocity cap in the simplified PathSimulation. In the evolved sim, bird speed was limited (e.g. max ~80 units/sec) based on energy or design, but the current path-following code can accelerate birds without bound (especially if they get stuck in a tight cohesion loop or if one bird bolts and others align to it). We need to impose a maximum velocity limit each frame. Implementation: after applying all forces in PathSimulation.step(), compute each agent’s speed vector magnitude and if it exceeds some max (say 100 units/sec), scale it down to that max. This will prevent the “10x speed” bug by ensuring no bird goes hyper-sonic. Additionally, check the integration time-step: the sim runs at 30Hz (dt ~0.033), so large frame time or unpausing after pause might cause a big step. After unpausing, make sure the server doesn’t lump many ticks at once. If needed, you might reset last_state on resume to avoid a jump
GitHub
 (though the velocity cap mostly solves the symptom). 9. Improve Flock Cohesion vs Path Following Balance: To ensure a smooth experience, we may need to fine-tune the balance between flocking forces and path-following. The goal is that birds follow the route in a natural formation, not as a single clump or string. If after enabling path-follow for all birds the flock bunches up too tightly on the line, consider reducing the path influence on non-leaders. For example, multiply the steering force by 0.5 for followers, as mentioned. Our boid settings in _apply_flocking already increase cohesion for followers when no path vs reduce it when path is set (see no_path_multiplier usage)
GitHub
GitHub
. With all birds now getting some path force, this might be sufficient. Just verify that the flock doesn’t scatter off the line. They should maintain spacing via separation (15x force on close neighbors is already in place
GitHub
). Minor tuning of neighbor radius or separation strength can be done if birds still clump or collide, but likely not a priority unless observed. 10. Hazard Avoidance (if needed): According to game_rules, birds with high hazard awareness should start avoiding storms/predators rather than flying straight through. The current PathSimulation doesn’t have explicit hazard avoidance – birds fly into hazards and just accumulate stress
GitHub
. As an improvement, we could implement a simple avoidance behavior: e.g., in PathSimulation.step(), detect if a bird is within a hazard’s radius and apply a repulsive force (steer opposite to hazard center). This would prevent the flock from beelining through storms blindly, matching the expectation that hazards are “escapable but challenging”
GitHub
. This could be a moderate effort, so prioritize it after the critical fixes. Even without this, the game is playable, but adding it would better align with described rules (birds should attempt to divert around danger given their awareness trait). 11. Victory Condition – Don’t End Level Early: The game currently declares victory and ends the level once 50% of the birds reach the destination
GitHub
, which is an arbitrary threshold. This is contrary to our design (“natural completion based on actual arrivals, no arbitrary thresholds”
GitHub
). It leads to cases where half the flock arrives but the rest haven’t finished the path, yet the game stops (“birds don’t follow the trajectory until the end”). To fix this, adjust the victory logic on the server (PathSimulation): remove or raise that 50% check. Instead, use a more natural condition. For example, victory when at least 1 bird arrives AND no birds remain airborne or simply when the flock has stopped (all birds either arrived or died). In practice, you can eliminate the elif self.arrivals >= len(self.agents)*0.5 block
GitHub
. The code above it already handles the cases: if all birds are gone and at least one arrived, mark victory
GitHub
; if all died with zero arrivals, failure
GitHub
. By removing the 50% rule, the simulation will continue until the remaining birds either make it or perish, allowing them to truly follow the path to the end. (Our design notes even suggested using a time-based cutoff like “no healthy birds left OR 60+ seconds” instead of a fixed percentage
GitHub
. We can ignore time for now and let energy depletion handle stragglers.) After this change, more of the flock might arrive (or die trying), which makes outcomes feel fairer and matches expectations. Remember to test that the level actually ends eventually – typically all birds will either reach or run out of energy. If a scenario arises where a few birds keep circling forever, we might introduce a long timeout (e.g. end after some minutes), but that’s unlikely with the energy system in place. 12. Proper Survivor Carry-Over: (Related to above, and to ensure correctness moving forward) We should double-check that the right birds carry over to the next leg. There is a known bug in continue_to_next_leg() where if any birds arrived, the code mistakenly revives all birds for the next leg (because it checks if agent.alive OR self.arrivals>0 for each agent
GitHub
GitHub
). This means even birds that died mid-flight get resurrected if some others made it, which is not intended. While this wasn’t explicitly noted by the user, it’s an important bug to fix for consistency. The fix: only revive birds that were alive at the end of the leg or that arrived. We can track arrivals separately or mark arrived birds in a list before setting them alive=False. The simplest solution: record a list of survivor_ids comprising (alive birds at end of simulation + arrived birds). Then on leg transition, only revive those in survivor_ids. This way, losses remain dead. Implementing this will ensure the next leg starts with the correct survivors, making the game challenge consistent (no magic revival).
Phase 3 – User Interface & Controls Improvements
13. UI Panels Should Never Obstruct Gameplay: The telemetry and genetics panels were meant to sit at the edges with some transparency
GitHub
GitHub
, but the user saw them “right in the middle of the game, hiding the game.” We need to ensure they are positioned correctly and don’t intercept clicks unintentionally. Steps to take:
Verify edge positioning: The code tries to position telemetry at (5,50) and genetics at (width-285,50) on resize
GitHub
. It’s possible that on certain screen sizes or due to a scaling issue, these ended up more central. Make sure that UIScene.handleResize() is always called after the game starts. We do call it on scene create and on resize events
GitHub
GitHub
. If the panels still appear off, adjust those coordinates. For instance, we can anchor the telemetry panel to the left by using panel.setPosition(0, 50) (instead of 5px in) and the genetics panel to the right by using width - panelWidth precisely. Also ensure the parent container (hudContainer) is at (0,0) and not offset. Small tweaks here will align the panels truly to screen edges.
Depth layering for UI vs Game: Right now, our game input logic only ignores clicks on UI objects with depth >= 100
GitHub
. However, many of our UI containers likely have default depth 0, meaning clicks on them are not recognized as UI and pass through to the game. We should set a high depth for UI Containers. For example, when creating telemetryPanel, geneticsPanel, etc., do panel.setDepth(200). The hudContainer itself could also get a high depth to lift all its children above game objects. This way, the clickedOnUI check will correctly detect clicks on these panels (their depth will be ≥100) and ignore them in the game scene
GitHub
. This prevents the situation where UI panels block the view but the game still registers clicks on birds or drawing underneath, which likely contributed to “buttons unclickable” or weird interactions.
Make UI backgrounds non-interactive or fully interactive: We need to decide how UI panels consume input. One approach: fully interactive – set the panel backgrounds interactive so they catch clicks (even if they do nothing) and thus prevent underlying game input. For instance, call bg.setInteractive() on the telemetry panel’s background graphics. The other approach: non-interactive – let clicks pass through transparent parts. Given we have the depth check mechanism, the simpler method is to make every UI element interactive (so it’s picked up in gameObjects under the pointer). Implement by adding setInteractive() to the containers or graphics of panels. For example, in createTelemetryPanel(), after creating bg (the panel background), do bg.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: false }). We already set the collapse arrow text interactive
GitHub
, but a click on other parts of the panel might not be caught. Making the whole panel interactive (even with no explicit handler) ensures gameObjects.some(obj.depth>=100) will include it. This paired with proper depth will reliably block game clicks when the user is actually clicking a UI panel.
Transparency and size: The panels already use alpha 0.75 backgrounds
GitHub
 which is fine. If they still feel intrusive, we can reduce the alpha further (say 0.5) or allow collapsing. We actually have a collapse toggle (“▼” arrow) for telemetry that hides its content
GitHub
. Ensure this toggle works (it should, since we set telemetryVisible and adjust height). Possibly increase the size of the toggle icon or make the entire header clickable for collapse, to improve usability. The genetics panel similarly could be made collapsible if it isn’t already. These are polish items – the main thing is panels should default to not covering the play area significantly. In our design, we explicitly wanted a “clean UI layout with edge-positioned panels to avoid gameplay blocking”
GitHub
, so now we enforce exactly that. After changes, test that you can draw paths and click birds near the screen edges without the side panels eating the clicks. If issues remain, fine-tune positions (e.g. maybe move telemetry slightly further left off the playfield).
14. Fix Unresponsive Buttons (Menu & Panels): The user noted some buttons were unclickable. With the depth and interactive fixes above, much of this should resolve (e.g. the Start Migration button will no longer accidentally trigger a game click or be blocked by an overlay). However, let’s also review each interactive element:
Start Game (Main Menu): This button worked to start the game, but ensure the transition is smooth. We fade out and start GameScene/UIScene, then emit loadFirstLevel
GitHub
. One issue: sometimes the UI scene might not be fully ready when that event fires. We added a 500ms delay in main before calling wsClient.loadLevel(0)
GitHub
 to account for that. That should be fine. Just confirm that the menu’s fade covers the transition and that the menu scene stops.
Level Start/Continue/Retry buttons: These are in the center panel (levelPanel). We create the start button container and set it interactive with a hit area
GitHub
GitHub
. That code is correct. If the “Continue” or “Retry” clicks weren’t registering, likely the planning panel was still up or an input layer issue. Once we hide the planning panel on level completion or failure (we do hide it when showing the level panel in endPlanningPhase and when showing completion/failure panel
GitHub
GitHub
), and fix input layering, these buttons should receive clicks. We should test clicking “Continue to Next Leg” flows into the next level (server sends new level_loaded and planning phase starts for the next leg) – our main handler for continue sends continue_migration correctly
GitHub
, and the server will send a new level_loaded for the next leg (for path mode it already does in continue_to_next_leg call
GitHub
). Similarly, test “Retry Level” triggers the new load (from step 5). Now that we tie retry to loadLevel(0) (or appropriate), the button will work.
HUD Buttons: The telemetry panel’s collapse arrow (▼) and any other small buttons (like a hypothetical pause or camera toggle if present) need to be easily clickable. We used setInteractive on the arrow text
GitHub
, which is okay (the text is small but clickable). We could enlarge its hit area slightly (e.g. wrap it in a transparent container or give it a padding). The controls panel (top-right) is toggled via the ‘H’ key (based on the text in it) – making a button for it wasn’t done, but not necessary now.
Camera Controls Keys: Not a “button”, but ensure the user knows or can find out about camera modes. We have keys: C for cycle camera and V for frame all
GitHub
. Since the user complained about camera, they might not have known about these. We can add a note in the on-screen controls panel text (it already lists V and C keys in controlsText string
GitHub
). Just verify that panel is accessible (press H to toggle controls panel per our text) and perhaps default it to visible on first game run so players see it. Currently controlsVisible is false by default
GitHub
 – maybe consider showing it briefly or mentioning keys in instructions.
In summary, after Phase 3 changes, the UI should be much more user-friendly: Panels at the edges (not masking gameplay)
GitHub
, buttons respond properly, and planning UI appears/disappears at the right times. This addresses the user’s UI/UX grievances directly.
Phase 4 – Camera & Visual Enhancements
15. Improve Camera Framing and Smoothness: The camera is set to “flock_follow” by default, with a 2-second lookahead and very slow smoothing (0.05)
GitHub
GitHub
. The user found the camera angles/definition unsatisfactory. We can tweak two aspects:
Camera movement: Reduce the lookahead and/or increase responsiveness. For instance, change predictionTime from 2.0 to 1.0 second, so the camera doesn’t pan so far ahead of the flock (which can cause the flock to edge out of frame on sudden turns). Also, increase cameraFollowSmoothness from 0.05 to maybe 0.1 or 0.15, so the camera catches up faster instead of lagging far behind. These small changes will make the camera more centered on the flock and less sluggish. We should test the effect: it should still be smooth, just not as floaty. Alternatively, we could switch to the “frame_all” mode dynamically when the flock spreads out, but that may be overkill. Our current implementation already allows pressing V to frame all birds (zooming out) and C to cycle modes
GitHub
. Since these are not obvious, perhaps default to a slightly wider view. We can do that by adjusting the camera zoom or using frame_all at level start. For example, when a level begins (after planning, before unpausing), call gameScene.frameAllBirds() once to set an initial view that contains the flock and destination. This might improve first impressions.
Rendering clarity (resolution): The “definition” issue could be due to pixel density on high-DPI screens. We should ensure the game uses device pixel ratio for crisp rendering. Phaser’s config allows a resolution setting. We can set resolution: window.devicePixelRatio in the game config (in MurmurationGame constructor where we define gameConfig
GitHub
). Also ensure antialias is true (it is by default for AUTO mode) and maybe roundPixels off, since we have smooth movement. This will make the sprites and text sharper on retina displays at the cost of more GPU usage. Given our game has at most a couple hundred simple sprites, this is fine. With a higher resolution canvas, the visuals (especially text in UI and bird sprites) should look much cleaner.
Camera bounds and world size: Check that the camera’s world bounds (worldWidth = 2000, worldHeight = 1200 in GameScene) cover the entire level area and that clamping works
GitHub
. If the flock or hazards ever spawn near edges (0 or 2000), the camera may hit the clamp and not show things just beyond. Since our destination is at x≈1850 (some padding), 2000 width is probably okay. Just be aware to adjust if needed (e.g., if you expand levels).
After these camera adjustments, observe the gameplay: the flock should remain nicely in view during migration, and the panning/zoom should feel smooth but not “distant.” The user specifically mentioned camera angles, which might refer to how the perspective felt. We use a top-down orthographic view (Phaser 2D), so there isn’t an angle per se. It was likely the camera positioning issue. The above changes directly target that. 16. Polish Visual Feedback: A few small improvements can greatly enhance the perceived smoothness:
Drawing Feedback: When the player draws the path, make sure the line is clearly visible (we do render it via pathGraphics in real-time). If not already, use a distinct color (e.g., bright cyan or white) and perhaps draw a semi-transparent “preview” segment as they drag (we have pathPreview object in GameScene for this). If the preview line isn’t implemented, consider drawing the line continuously in continuePathDrawing(). Currently it likely just stores points and finalizes on pointerup. Real-time feedback is important for a smooth experience. If needed, call pathGraphics.lineTo(pointer.worldX, pointer.worldY) on pointermove events to show the line as it’s being drawn (and reset when clearing).
Bird Animations: Check that the BirdAnimationSystem is updating sprite rotations and flapping properly. If the birds currently look static or teleporty, maybe interpolation isn’t functioning. We do call interpolatePositions() each frame
GitHub
. Ensure that delta is correct (Phaser’s delta vs our tick rate). They appear okay, but watch for any stutter – we can adjust interpolation factor or simply trust Phaser physics interpolation. Given performance is fine, this is minor.
Telemetry info placement: Right now the telemetry text (Population, Cohesion, etc.) updates in the left panel. If any of those values overlap or are hard to read, adjust spacing or content. E.g., “Average Energy” might be a long text causing line wrap. We can abbreviate labels or widen the panel (we already adjust background to 280px when expanded
GitHub
, though initial width was 200px). Small UI text tweaks like these can make the telemetry panel look more professional.
Final win/lose screens: Make sure the success/failure text is clear. On win, we set “MIGRATION LEG COMPLETE!” in green
GitHub
GitHub
; on failure, “MIGRATION FAILED” in red
GitHub
, with stats. Ensure the color contrast is good against the panel background (which is dark blue). Possibly make the text a bit larger. And verify the panel actually appears on top of everything (should be, since we reuse levelPanel which is in HUD). With the depth fixes, it should still be above the game scene.
By addressing all the above, we end up with a roadmap of changes that elevate the game from an “unplayable” state to one aligned with our design documentation. In Phase 1, we fixed the critical blockers: proper planning phase and game reset, which immediately yields a smooth bird experience by letting the player guide the flock as intended. In Phase 2, we corrected the flock AI and physics so the birds behave according to the rules (following the drawn route, not spazzing out or ending mid-way). Phase 3 then cleaned up the UI so nothing is blocking or unresponsive, making the interface intuitive (panels on edges, buttons doing their job). Finally, Phase 4 fine-tuned the camera and visuals to polish the overall feel (better framing, sharper graphics). This sequence of improvements should be tackled in roughly this order, as each phase builds on the stability achieved in the previous. After implementing Phase 1 and 2, the game will be fully playable; Phase 3 and 4 then ensure it’s enjoyable and matches the promised quality. All these fixes together address the issues observed in the deployed version and realign the game with the design described earlier (and in game_rules.md). The end result will be a far more playable and professional-looking Murmuration game, where the UI no longer hinders the gameplay, and the birds truly follow the player’s drawn path through to the destination (or die trying) – just as we planned.

Phase 1 – Fix Core Gameplay Flow (Highest Priority)
1. Enable the Pre-Level Planning Phase (Trajectory Drawing): Currently, after the “Start Level” button is clicked, the game unpauses immediately and birds launch before any path is drawn
GitHub
. This breaks the intended planning phase described in our design. To fix this, we must trigger the path-drawing mode instead of immediately resuming the simulation. In practice:
Stop auto-resume on Start Level: Remove or disable the wsClient.resumeGame() call on the startLevel event
GitHub
. Instead, initiate planning mode by calling GameScene.startPlanningPhase(). This will pause the simulation and allow path drawing (it already emits a togglePause to pause and sets isPlanningPhase=true
GitHub
).
Show the planning UI: The startPlanningPhase() method in GameScene already signals the UI scene to show the planning panel
GitHub
GitHub
. Ensure that event is fired. After clicking “Start Level”, the player should see the “Plan Your Route” panel with drawing instructions, and the game remains paused. This aligns with the design where the player draws the trajectory before flight
GitHub
.
2. Hide Planning Panel During Drawing: Currently, the instruction panel stays on screen while drawing, obstructing the view (“the panel in the middle does not disappear to let him draw”). To improve UX, auto-hide it on first draw action. For example, in the pointerdown handler for drawing, once we detect a left-click in planning mode (i.e. user starts drawing), call UIScene.hidePlanningPanel() to close the overlay. This can be added in GameScene.startPathDrawing() or right inside the pointerdown event before starting the path. The planning panel is already a Phaser Container; we just need to set it invisible when drawing begins. The UI scene’s hidePlanningPanel will also restore other HUD panels
GitHub
. 3. Prevent Starting Flight Without a Drawn Path: As it stands, the player can hit “Start Migration” with no path drawn, causing the flock to fly aimlessly at spawn. We should disable or guard the Start Migration button until a valid path is drawn. For instance, keep the “Start Migration” button non-interactive (greyed out) initially, and enable it when drawnPath length > 0. A quick solution is to check in UIScene.startMigration() (the handler for that button) if the path is empty and, if so, refuse to proceed (possibly show a message like “Draw a path first!”). This prevents launching the level without guidance. The code already only sends the path if one exists
GitHub
, but we need to also stay in planning mode if drawnPath is empty (do not emit startMigration or call endPlanningPhase). In summary: don’t call GameScene.endPlanningPhase() unless a path exists. 4. Ensure Path Starts/Ends at Correct Points: To make bird behavior match the rules, enforce the path start/end constraints described in our design (path should begin near the flock and end at the destination). We can implement simple checks when the player finishes drawing (in finishPathDrawing()): if the first waypoint is too far from the flock’s start position, consider prepending a point at the flock’s start. Likewise, if the last waypoint is not within the destination radius, automatically append the destination as the final point. This ensures the drawn route is complete. (At minimum, warn or prevent the Start button if the path doesn’t reach the goal.) These tweaks guarantee the flock actually has a route from A to B as intended, rather than stopping short. 5. Fix Game Restart on Loss: When the player loses (all birds die), the “Retry Level” button currently does nothing – the game stays stuck because we never reset the simulation. To fix this, wire the Retry flow to actually reload the level. The simplest approach: on “Retry Level” click (which triggers the startLevel event with the panel text “RETRY”
GitHub
), instead of resuming a nonexistent game, call our level-load function to start a fresh simulation. For example, in the startLevel handler, detect if it was a retry (we could set a flag when showing the failure panel) and invoke wsClient.loadLevel(0) or the appropriate level index. In practice, since a total wipeout ends the migration, we likely restart from the first leg with a new flock. Calling start_unified (via wsClient.loadLevel(0)) will create a new PathSimulation on the server
GitHub
 and send a fresh level_loaded for leg 1. The UI will show the Level 1 panel again and allow planning. This ensures the game can be played again without a full page refresh. 6. Sequence Testing: After implementing the above, test the full flow: Start Game → Level intro panel → Start Level (should enter planning mode, not unpause) → draw path → Start Migration (should send path and unpause simulation) → play through level → if fail, Retry (should reload level state and show intro panel again) → if succeed, Continue (next leg). This sequence should now match the intended smooth experience, with no “broken” clicks or dead buttons.
Phase 2 – Fix Bird Movement & Simulation Behavior
7. Enforce Birds Follow the Drawn Path to Completion: In the current build, many birds are not actually following the trajectory all the way, especially if leaders die or stray. One major cause is that only the designated leader birds (5 of them) are influenced by the drawn path – the rest just flock among themselves
GitHub
. If those few leaders perish early or diverge, the remaining flock has no path guidance. To address this, we should make all birds at least weakly follow the path waypoints (not just leaders). A straightforward fix is to call the path-following logic for every bird each tick, albeit with different strength for leaders vs followers. For example, remove the condition so that _follow_path() applies to all agents, and inside it use a smaller path_strength for non-leaders. Concretely, in PathSimulation.step(), after computing boid forces, add something like: if path exists: agent.velocity += (path_direction * k) for all birds. You can achieve this by moving the if self.is_leader check inside _follow_path or by looping through all agents with _follow_path unconditionally (adjusting force based on role). This change will ensure even “follower” birds stay on course behind the leaders. The result should be a much tighter adherence to the drawn trajectory by the entire flock, as originally described in game_rules. It aligns with the intended behavior that the flock “maintains separation and cohesion but prefers to stick to the planned route”
GitHub
. 8. Cap Extreme Bird Speeds and Jittery Movement: Right now, as observed, a large portion of the flock sometimes “fly at 10x speed into the top-left corner.” This is likely due to an absence of a velocity cap in the simplified PathSimulation. In the evolved sim, bird speed was limited (e.g. max ~80 units/sec) based on energy or design, but the current path-following code can accelerate birds without bound (especially if they get stuck in a tight cohesion loop or if one bird bolts and others align to it). We need to impose a maximum velocity limit each frame. Implementation: after applying all forces in PathSimulation.step(), compute each agent’s speed vector magnitude and if it exceeds some max (say 100 units/sec), scale it down to that max. This will prevent the “10x speed” bug by ensuring no bird goes hyper-sonic. Additionally, check the integration time-step: the sim runs at 30Hz (dt ~0.033), so large frame time or unpausing after pause might cause a big step. After unpausing, make sure the server doesn’t lump many ticks at once. If needed, you might reset last_state on resume to avoid a jump
GitHub
 (though the velocity cap mostly solves the symptom). 9. Improve Flock Cohesion vs Path Following Balance: To ensure a smooth experience, we may need to fine-tune the balance between flocking forces and path-following. The goal is that birds follow the route in a natural formation, not as a single clump or string. If after enabling path-follow for all birds the flock bunches up too tightly on the line, consider reducing the path influence on non-leaders. For example, multiply the steering force by 0.5 for followers, as mentioned. Our boid settings in _apply_flocking already increase cohesion for followers when no path vs reduce it when path is set (see no_path_multiplier usage)
GitHub
GitHub
. With all birds now getting some path force, this might be sufficient. Just verify that the flock doesn’t scatter off the line. They should maintain spacing via separation (15x force on close neighbors is already in place
GitHub
). Minor tuning of neighbor radius or separation strength can be done if birds still clump or collide, but likely not a priority unless observed. 10. Hazard Avoidance (if needed): According to game_rules, birds with high hazard awareness should start avoiding storms/predators rather than flying straight through. The current PathSimulation doesn’t have explicit hazard avoidance – birds fly into hazards and just accumulate stress
GitHub
. As an improvement, we could implement a simple avoidance behavior: e.g., in PathSimulation.step(), detect if a bird is within a hazard’s radius and apply a repulsive force (steer opposite to hazard center). This would prevent the flock from beelining through storms blindly, matching the expectation that hazards are “escapable but challenging”
GitHub
. This could be a moderate effort, so prioritize it after the critical fixes. Even without this, the game is playable, but adding it would better align with described rules (birds should attempt to divert around danger given their awareness trait). 11. Victory Condition – Don’t End Level Early: The game currently declares victory and ends the level once 50% of the birds reach the destination
GitHub
, which is an arbitrary threshold. This is contrary to our design (“natural completion based on actual arrivals, no arbitrary thresholds”
GitHub
). It leads to cases where half the flock arrives but the rest haven’t finished the path, yet the game stops (“birds don’t follow the trajectory until the end”). To fix this, adjust the victory logic on the server (PathSimulation): remove or raise that 50% check. Instead, use a more natural condition. For example, victory when at least 1 bird arrives AND no birds remain airborne or simply when the flock has stopped (all birds either arrived or died). In practice, you can eliminate the elif self.arrivals >= len(self.agents)*0.5 block
GitHub
. The code above it already handles the cases: if all birds are gone and at least one arrived, mark victory
GitHub
; if all died with zero arrivals, failure
GitHub
. By removing the 50% rule, the simulation will continue until the remaining birds either make it or perish, allowing them to truly follow the path to the end. (Our design notes even suggested using a time-based cutoff like “no healthy birds left OR 60+ seconds” instead of a fixed percentage
GitHub
. We can ignore time for now and let energy depletion handle stragglers.) After this change, more of the flock might arrive (or die trying), which makes outcomes feel fairer and matches expectations. Remember to test that the level actually ends eventually – typically all birds will either reach or run out of energy. If a scenario arises where a few birds keep circling forever, we might introduce a long timeout (e.g. end after some minutes), but that’s unlikely with the energy system in place. 12. Proper Survivor Carry-Over: (Related to above, and to ensure correctness moving forward) We should double-check that the right birds carry over to the next leg. There is a known bug in continue_to_next_leg() where if any birds arrived, the code mistakenly revives all birds for the next leg (because it checks if agent.alive OR self.arrivals>0 for each agent
GitHub
GitHub
). This means even birds that died mid-flight get resurrected if some others made it, which is not intended. While this wasn’t explicitly noted by the user, it’s an important bug to fix for consistency. The fix: only revive birds that were alive at the end of the leg or that arrived. We can track arrivals separately or mark arrived birds in a list before setting them alive=False. The simplest solution: record a list of survivor_ids comprising (alive birds at end of simulation + arrived birds). Then on leg transition, only revive those in survivor_ids. This way, losses remain dead. Implementing this will ensure the next leg starts with the correct survivors, making the game challenge consistent (no magic revival).
Phase 3 – User Interface & Controls Improvements
13. UI Panels Should Never Obstruct Gameplay: The telemetry and genetics panels were meant to sit at the edges with some transparency
GitHub
GitHub
, but the user saw them “right in the middle of the game, hiding the game.” We need to ensure they are positioned correctly and don’t intercept clicks unintentionally. Steps to take:
Verify edge positioning: The code tries to position telemetry at (5,50) and genetics at (width-285,50) on resize
GitHub
. It’s possible that on certain screen sizes or due to a scaling issue, these ended up more central. Make sure that UIScene.handleResize() is always called after the game starts. We do call it on scene create and on resize events
GitHub
GitHub
. If the panels still appear off, adjust those coordinates. For instance, we can anchor the telemetry panel to the left by using panel.setPosition(0, 50) (instead of 5px in) and the genetics panel to the right by using width - panelWidth precisely. Also ensure the parent container (hudContainer) is at (0,0) and not offset. Small tweaks here will align the panels truly to screen edges.
Depth layering for UI vs Game: Right now, our game input logic only ignores clicks on UI objects with depth >= 100
GitHub
. However, many of our UI containers likely have default depth 0, meaning clicks on them are not recognized as UI and pass through to the game. We should set a high depth for UI Containers. For example, when creating telemetryPanel, geneticsPanel, etc., do panel.setDepth(200). The hudContainer itself could also get a high depth to lift all its children above game objects. This way, the clickedOnUI check will correctly detect clicks on these panels (their depth will be ≥100) and ignore them in the game scene
GitHub
. This prevents the situation where UI panels block the view but the game still registers clicks on birds or drawing underneath, which likely contributed to “buttons unclickable” or weird interactions.
Make UI backgrounds non-interactive or fully interactive: We need to decide how UI panels consume input. One approach: fully interactive – set the panel backgrounds interactive so they catch clicks (even if they do nothing) and thus prevent underlying game input. For instance, call bg.setInteractive() on the telemetry panel’s background graphics. The other approach: non-interactive – let clicks pass through transparent parts. Given we have the depth check mechanism, the simpler method is to make every UI element interactive (so it’s picked up in gameObjects under the pointer). Implement by adding setInteractive() to the containers or graphics of panels. For example, in createTelemetryPanel(), after creating bg (the panel background), do bg.setInteractive({ useHandCursor: false }). We already set the collapse arrow text interactive
GitHub
, but a click on other parts of the panel might not be caught. Making the whole panel interactive (even with no explicit handler) ensures gameObjects.some(obj.depth>=100) will include it. This paired with proper depth will reliably block game clicks when the user is actually clicking a UI panel.
Transparency and size: The panels already use alpha 0.75 backgrounds
GitHub
 which is fine. If they still feel intrusive, we can reduce the alpha further (say 0.5) or allow collapsing. We actually have a collapse toggle (“▼” arrow) for telemetry that hides its content
GitHub
. Ensure this toggle works (it should, since we set telemetryVisible and adjust height). Possibly increase the size of the toggle icon or make the entire header clickable for collapse, to improve usability. The genetics panel similarly could be made collapsible if it isn’t already. These are polish items – the main thing is panels should default to not covering the play area significantly. In our design, we explicitly wanted a “clean UI layout with edge-positioned panels to avoid gameplay blocking”
GitHub
, so now we enforce exactly that. After changes, test that you can draw paths and click birds near the screen edges without the side panels eating the clicks. If issues remain, fine-tune positions (e.g. maybe move telemetry slightly further left off the playfield).
14. Fix Unresponsive Buttons (Menu & Panels): The user noted some buttons were unclickable. With the depth and interactive fixes above, much of this should resolve (e.g. the Start Migration button will no longer accidentally trigger a game click or be blocked by an overlay). However, let’s also review each interactive element:
Start Game (Main Menu): This button worked to start the game, but ensure the transition is smooth. We fade out and start GameScene/UIScene, then emit loadFirstLevel
GitHub
. One issue: sometimes the UI scene might not be fully ready when that event fires. We added a 500ms delay in main before calling wsClient.loadLevel(0)
GitHub
 to account for that. That should be fine. Just confirm that the menu’s fade covers the transition and that the menu scene stops.
Level Start/Continue/Retry buttons: These are in the center panel (levelPanel). We create the start button container and set it interactive with a hit area
GitHub
GitHub
. That code is correct. If the “Continue” or “Retry” clicks weren’t registering, likely the planning panel was still up or an input layer issue. Once we hide the planning panel on level completion or failure (we do hide it when showing the level panel in endPlanningPhase and when showing completion/failure panel
GitHub
GitHub
), and fix input layering, these buttons should receive clicks. We should test clicking “Continue to Next Leg” flows into the next level (server sends new level_loaded and planning phase starts for the next leg) – our main handler for continue sends continue_migration correctly
GitHub
, and the server will send a new level_loaded for the next leg (for path mode it already does in continue_to_next_leg call
GitHub
). Similarly, test “Retry Level” triggers the new load (from step 5). Now that we tie retry to loadLevel(0) (or appropriate), the button will work.
HUD Buttons: The telemetry panel’s collapse arrow (▼) and any other small buttons (like a hypothetical pause or camera toggle if present) need to be easily clickable. We used setInteractive on the arrow text
GitHub
, which is okay (the text is small but clickable). We could enlarge its hit area slightly (e.g. wrap it in a transparent container or give it a padding). The controls panel (top-right) is toggled via the ‘H’ key (based on the text in it) – making a button for it wasn’t done, but not necessary now.
Camera Controls Keys: Not a “button”, but ensure the user knows or can find out about camera modes. We have keys: C for cycle camera and V for frame all
GitHub
. Since the user complained about camera, they might not have known about these. We can add a note in the on-screen controls panel text (it already lists V and C keys in controlsText string
GitHub
). Just verify that panel is accessible (press H to toggle controls panel per our text) and perhaps default it to visible on first game run so players see it. Currently controlsVisible is false by default
GitHub
 – maybe consider showing it briefly or mentioning keys in instructions.
In summary, after Phase 3 changes, the UI should be much more user-friendly: Panels at the edges (not masking gameplay)
GitHub
, buttons respond properly, and planning UI appears/disappears at the right times. This addresses the user’s UI/UX grievances directly.
Phase 4 – Camera & Visual Enhancements
15. Improve Camera Framing and Smoothness: The camera is set to “flock_follow” by default, with a 2-second lookahead and very slow smoothing (0.05)
GitHub
GitHub
. The user found the camera angles/definition unsatisfactory. We can tweak two aspects:
Camera movement: Reduce the lookahead and/or increase responsiveness. For instance, change predictionTime from 2.0 to 1.0 second, so the camera doesn’t pan so far ahead of the flock (which can cause the flock to edge out of frame on sudden turns). Also, increase cameraFollowSmoothness from 0.05 to maybe 0.1 or 0.15, so the camera catches up faster instead of lagging far behind. These small changes will make the camera more centered on the flock and less sluggish. We should test the effect: it should still be smooth, just not as floaty. Alternatively, we could switch to the “frame_all” mode dynamically when the flock spreads out, but that may be overkill. Our current implementation already allows pressing V to frame all birds (zooming out) and C to cycle modes
GitHub
. Since these are not obvious, perhaps default to a slightly wider view. We can do that by adjusting the camera zoom or using frame_all at level start. For example, when a level begins (after planning, before unpausing), call gameScene.frameAllBirds() once to set an initial view that contains the flock and destination. This might improve first impressions.
Rendering clarity (resolution): The “definition” issue could be due to pixel density on high-DPI screens. We should ensure the game uses device pixel ratio for crisp rendering. Phaser’s config allows a resolution setting. We can set resolution: window.devicePixelRatio in the game config (in MurmurationGame constructor where we define gameConfig
GitHub
). Also ensure antialias is true (it is by default for AUTO mode) and maybe roundPixels off, since we have smooth movement. This will make the sprites and text sharper on retina displays at the cost of more GPU usage. Given our game has at most a couple hundred simple sprites, this is fine. With a higher resolution canvas, the visuals (especially text in UI and bird sprites) should look much cleaner.
Camera bounds and world size: Check that the camera’s world bounds (worldWidth = 2000, worldHeight = 1200 in GameScene) cover the entire level area and that clamping works
GitHub
. If the flock or hazards ever spawn near edges (0 or 2000), the camera may hit the clamp and not show things just beyond. Since our destination is at x≈1850 (some padding), 2000 width is probably okay. Just be aware to adjust if needed (e.g., if you expand levels).
After these camera adjustments, observe the gameplay: the flock should remain nicely in view during migration, and the panning/zoom should feel smooth but not “distant.” The user specifically mentioned camera angles, which might refer to how the perspective felt. We use a top-down orthographic view (Phaser 2D), so there isn’t an angle per se. It was likely the camera positioning issue. The above changes directly target that. 16. Polish Visual Feedback: A few small improvements can greatly enhance the perceived smoothness:
Drawing Feedback: When the player draws the path, make sure the line is clearly visible (we do render it via pathGraphics in real-time). If not already, use a distinct color (e.g., bright cyan or white) and perhaps draw a semi-transparent “preview” segment as they drag (we have pathPreview object in GameScene for this). If the preview line isn’t implemented, consider drawing the line continuously in continuePathDrawing(). Currently it likely just stores points and finalizes on pointerup. Real-time feedback is important for a smooth experience. If needed, call pathGraphics.lineTo(pointer.worldX, pointer.worldY) on pointermove events to show the line as it’s being drawn (and reset when clearing).
Bird Animations: Check that the BirdAnimationSystem is updating sprite rotations and flapping properly. If the birds currently look static or teleporty, maybe interpolation isn’t functioning. We do call interpolatePositions() each frame
GitHub
. Ensure that delta is correct (Phaser’s delta vs our tick rate). They appear okay, but watch for any stutter – we can adjust interpolation factor or simply trust Phaser physics interpolation. Given performance is fine, this is minor.
Telemetry info placement: Right now the telemetry text (Population, Cohesion, etc.) updates in the left panel. If any of those values overlap or are hard to read, adjust spacing or content. E.g., “Average Energy” might be a long text causing line wrap. We can abbreviate labels or widen the panel (we already adjust background to 280px when expanded
GitHub
, though initial width was 200px). Small UI text tweaks like these can make the telemetry panel look more professional.
Final win/lose screens: Make sure the success/failure text is clear. On win, we set “MIGRATION LEG COMPLETE!” in green
GitHub
GitHub
; on failure, “MIGRATION FAILED” in red
GitHub
, with stats. Ensure the color contrast is good against the panel background (which is dark blue). Possibly make the text a bit larger. And verify the panel actually appears on top of everything (should be, since we reuse levelPanel which is in HUD). With the depth fixes, it should still be above the game scene.
By addressing all the above, we end up with a roadmap of changes that elevate the game from an “unplayable” state to one aligned with our design documentation. In Phase 1, we fixed the critical blockers: proper planning phase and game reset, which immediately yields a smooth bird experience by letting the player guide the flock as intended. In Phase 2, we corrected the flock AI and physics so the birds behave according to the rules (following the drawn route, not spazzing out or ending mid-way). Phase 3 then cleaned up the UI so nothing is blocking or unresponsive, making the interface intuitive (panels on edges, buttons doing their job). Finally, Phase 4 fine-tuned the camera and visuals to polish the overall feel (better framing, sharper graphics). This sequence of improvements should be tackled in roughly this order, as each phase builds on the stability achieved in the previous. After implementing Phase 1 and 2, the game will be fully playable; Phase 3 and 4 then ensure it’s enjoyable and matches the promised quality. All these fixes together address the issues observed in the deployed version and realign the game with the design described earlier (and in game_rules.md). The end result will be a far more playable and professional-looking Murmuration game, where the UI no longer hinders the gameplay, and the birds truly follow the player’s drawn path through to the destination (or die trying) – just as we planned.

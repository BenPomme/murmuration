Roadmap Implementation Audit

Delivered Features: Many Phase 1 items are implemented. The game now has a multi-leg migration structure with a “Next Leg” flow (manual progression) and persistent genetic traits. Environmental food sites are generated and rendered on the map with green pulsing icons and restore bird energy when flocks enter the radius
GitHub
GitHub
. Player-placed food beacons have indeed been removed in favor of these static sites (the code rejects any 'food' beacon placement)
GitHub
. The beacon system includes a budget (e.g. beacon_budget=3 for wind beacons) and limits spamming. Birds are now gender-differentiated – male birds get a subtle blue tint in-game
GitHub
 and UI panels use blue/rose colors and symbols
GitHub
. The hazard mechanics have advanced: storms use a custom sprite (tornado.png) and have multi-tier danger zones
GitHub
GitHub
, and predators use chase logic (timed pursuit with fatigue) so that their kill chance drops if birds evade long enough
GitHub
GitHub
. The game’s telemetry HUD (left panel) and genetics panel (right panel) provide real-time stats on flock health, cohesion, energy, and trait averages as intended. Bird inspection pop-ups are implemented on click, showing individual stats and trait bars
GitHub
GitHub
, fulfilling the “bird inspection” UI goal. Core flock evolution between migrations is partially there – after a full migration, survivors get trait boosts (e.g. +0.08 hazard awareness for storm survivors) and breeding occurs to replenish the flock
GitHub
GitHub
. Performance considerations like object pooling, frustum culling, etc., are also present in the code. These delivered features align well with the Roadmap Phase 1 goals (e.g. slowing bird speed, using storm assets, gender visuals, basic beacon strategy).

Missing / Incomplete Features: Several critical roadmap items are not fully realized. Notably, the strategic gameplay loop is only half-implemented – while multiple legs exist, the flock does not truly persist across legs. The code currently resets the bird count to 100 at the start of each new leg regardless of survivors, instead of carrying over only the survivors. In the server’s migration code, after a leg ends it logs continuing with X survivors but then calls load_level for the next leg without actually using those survivors
GitHub
GitHub
. This means casualties don’t impact the next leg’s starting population – a design break from the roadmap’s intent of dwindling flocks (the Roadmap’s “persisting state between levels” is effectively missing). Difficulty progression is therefore flatter than intended. Also missing is a dedicated migration results screen or final summary – upon finishing all legs there is no polished end-of-migration UI to recap trait evolution or generation changes (breeding happens in code, but the player isn’t presented with a results overview, contrary to roadmap UI goals). The level design/checkpoint progression is only rudimentary: the journey uses fixed templates (e.g. “W1-1” levels) instead of a fully procedural A→B→C path generation – it works, but lacks variety and narrative context (Phase 2/3 plans like dynamic leg count or seasonal variations aren’t in place). In terms of hazards, while storms are visualized, predator visuals are missing – the code loads predator.png but never actually adds predator sprites to the scene
GitHub
GitHub
, so predators are invisible (only their effect radius is shown). UI/UX feedback is also incomplete: e.g. there’s no on-screen indicator of beacon quantity used/remaining, even though beacon_budget is tracked (this could be shown on the HUD). And although traits do evolve, there’s no trait evolution visualization between migrations (no graph or summary for how genetics changed generation to generation, which was a roadmap item). These gaps mean some Phase 2 depth (like moving hazards, advanced beacon types, or the breeding selection UI) is not yet present – understandable at this stage, but worth noting for completeness.

Display & UI Issues

1. Overlapping Pop-ups and Blurred Screen: There are problems with multiple UI windows stacking and obscuring the game. For example, the level transition panels (the large center screen pop-ups for “Start Level” and “Leg Complete”) use a full-screen semi-transparent backdrop. If another window (like the bird-inspection panel) is open underneath, it remains active and becomes faintly visible through the dark overlay, causing a confusing double-UI effect. Currently, nothing triggers the bird info panel to close when a level-completion panel appears. Solution: ensure only one popup at a time. We can fix this by forcibly hiding secondary pop-ups whenever a major modal opens. For instance, when showing the level-complete panel, call hideBirdInspection() to destroy any inspection panel still open. This can be done in the main event handler for level completion. For example:

// In main.ts, after receiving level_complete:
if (data.type === 'level_completed') {
    uiScene.showCompletionPanel(data.data);
    gameScene.hideBirdInspection();  // Close any bird info pop-up
}


This way, the bird info window won’t linger behind the blurred overlay. Similarly, if there are other small panels (settings, etc.), they should be closed or suspended when a full-screen modal is active.

2. Multiple Modal Overlays (“Double Blur”): The design of UIScene.createLevelPanel() already tries to prevent multiple overlays by destroying any existing panel before creating a new one
GitHub
. However, due to how the panel is reused between level start and completion, a logic bug allows the backdrop to “double up.” After a level, the code repurposes the same panel for the completion screen (changing text to “CONTINUE…”) and then hides it. On the next level start, it reuses the hidden panel instead of fully rebuilding it, so it doesn’t re-add the backdrop – if something triggers creation of a second backdrop, the screen can become overly dark. The safer approach is to always destroy and recreate the panel for a new level rather than hiding and reusing it. We can tweak the logic in showLevelPanel to rebuild the UI if it was previously used for a completion. For example:

public showLevelPanel(levelNumber: number, ... ) {
    // If panel was used for completion before, destroy it to reset state
    if (this.isCompletionPanel && this.levelPanel) {
        this.levelPanel.destroy();
        this.levelPanel = null;
        this.isCompletionPanel = false;
    }
    if (!this.levelPanel) {
        this.createLevelPanel();
    }
    // ...then update texts as usual
}


This ensures the backdrop and text are always in a clean state. It prevents any cumulative darkening or blurring from reusing an already semi-transparent overlay. After implementing this, the screen will have only one correct overlay at a time, keeping the display crisp.

3. Modal Button Text/State Not Reset: A related UI bug is that the “Start Level” button text isn’t reverting properly. On level completion, the code updates the panel’s button to say “CONTINUE TO NEXT LEG”
GitHub
, but when the next level loads, the panel is reused without changing it back, so players have seen the wrong button label. As noted, rebuilding the panel each time is one fix. Alternatively, we could explicitly reset the button. For instance, at the top of showLevelPanel, if this.isCompletionPanel was true, we know the button says “CONTINUE…”, so we can find that text and set it to “START LEVEL” again (and restore its green styling). Recreating the panel (as above) is simpler – it naturally resets the text to the default “START LEVEL” as defined in createLevelPanel()
GitHub
. This fix will eliminate the confusion of seeing “Continue” when a level hasn’t started yet.

4. Camera Not Initially Following Flock: Currently the camera starts in manual mode, which is not beginner-friendly – birds can fly off-screen because the player must actively pan or toggle the camera mode. The code defaults cameraMode = 'manual'
GitHub
, meaning the view will not track the flock unless the user knows to press C (cycle camera) to enable “Follow Flock” mode
GitHub
. As the user noted, “levels and the playing field are not restricted to the window” – this is essentially because of the manual camera allowing the flock to leave the view. The game should feel more polished by making the camera auto-follow by default. Solution: set the initial camera mode to 'flock_follow'. For example, in GameScene’s constructor or create, initialize this.cameraMode = 'flock_follow'; instead of manual. And/or call cycleCameraMode() once on scene start to switch to follow mode automatically. Additionally, we might call the existing frameAllBirds() once the first level starts, so the camera zooms out to fit the whole flock nicely at the beginning. This one-line change (setting the default mode) ensures the action stays on-screen and “things [don’t] happen outside of the camera.” The camera bounds are already set to the world size
GitHub
, so it won’t wander beyond the map. After this fix, the flock will remain in view, greatly improving perceived professionalism of the display.

5. Minor Visual Polish Issues: A few smaller display quirks can be addressed for a truly impeccable look. For example, the predator hazard currently has no visual representation, which can confuse players (birds might die “out of nowhere”). We should render the predator sprite on the map when a predator hazard spawns. The code has a loaded texture predator_sprite
GitHub
; we can add logic in the hazard renderer (similar to the tornado sprite usage
GitHub
) to create an image for predators. For instance, inside createHazardVisual() in GameScene, add: if (hazard.type === 'predator') { /* add predator sprite at hazard.position, perhaps an animated eagle icon, with some tween for circling motion */ }. This gives players a visual cue of the threat. We should also ensure the HUD panels don’t overlap important content – currently the left HUD and right genetics panel are semi-transparent and nicely sized, so this is okay, but if any panel obscures too much of the play area (especially on smaller screens), we might consider allowing players to toggle them. Given the roadmap’s focus on accessibility, we might add a key (like H) to hide/show the HUD for an unobstructed view, though this is a feature suggestion beyond bug fixes. Lastly, verifying that text contrast and sizes are consistent will add polish – e.g. the level titles and subtitles on the panels use a smaller font for subtitles (“Migration Leg A-B”) which sometimes might not stand out against the backdrop. Using a slightly larger or brighter font for the subtitle could improve readability on some displays. These are fine-tuning suggestions to reach that “impeccable” visual quality.

Game Balance and Mechanics Issues

1. Hazard Lethality & Difficulty Curve: The current hazard settings are still quite punishing and may need tuning for balance. The roadmap analysis noted storm and predator kill chances were high, and the code has adjusted storms to ~5–14% kill chance (down from 8–18%)
GitHub
 which is good. Predators, however, still have up to an 18% base kill chance in later legs
GitHub
 (down from 25%, but starting at ~10% for leg1). This might still feel high when combined with the new chase mechanics. If playtesting shows frequent flock wipeouts, consider reducing predator kill chance further to, say, 5% base + 1.5%/leg (so ~5–11%) or making predators wound instead of outright kill some percentage of the time. The hazard frequency could also scale more gently – currently hazard_count = migration_id (1 storm in migration1, but up to 4 in migration4 plus predators)
GitHub
. If players are losing too many birds early, we might start with 1 hazard for first two migrations, then increase. In code, that’s easy to adjust in MigrationConfig.generate_leg or the hazard generation logic.

2. Energy & Food Balance: The distance-based energy consumption and food site placement seem well thought-out (each leg is designed to require at least one stop)
GitHub
GitHub
. One potential balance issue is how quickly energy refills at food sites. The code sets an energy_restore_rate (8.0 in generation for some legs)
GitHub
 and the BeaconManager uses that to give energy back at restore_rate per tick strength
GitHub
. We should verify that birds actually get back to 100% energy when lingering at a food site. If not, we may need to increase that rate or the radius so more birds can feed simultaneously. Another consideration: since players no longer place food beacons, they have less direct control – thus the fixed food sites must be forgiving enough in placement. We might randomize food a bit less (currently Y is random 400–800) so that it doesn’t spawn too far off the flock’s likely path. Keeping food within a reasonable band ensures players always have a viable route.

3. Population Carry-Over & Difficulty: As mentioned, the game currently replenishes the flock to 100 birds each leg, which makes the game easier (you essentially get a full-strength flock every leg). This is both a balance and a design issue. The intent was likely that if you finish Leg 1 with 80 birds alive, you start Leg 2 with 80 birds – making later legs harder if you took heavy losses. Right now, because the code calls self.birds.clear() and refills the population to 100 every time during breeding or level load
GitHub
GitHub
, the challenge of maintaining your flock is lost. To fix this, we have a couple of options:

Use the UnifiedSimulation approach: Instead of fully terminating the simulation each leg, we could run one continuous simulation across legs. The UnifiedSimulation class actually supports multi-leg progression with persistent birds (see its advance_to_next_leg logic which repositions survivors and refills energy
GitHub
GitHub
). Switching to use unified_sim for the journey would inherently carry over only survivors (and it already handles breeding after the final leg). This would be a larger refactor on the server side, but it aligns exactly with the roadmap vision.

Adjust the EvolvedSimulation path: If we stick to loading a new level each leg, we can modify the server logic to pass the number of survivors into the next level’s setup. For example, after a leg, we know how many birds survived (survivors = self.simulation.arrivals in server.py)
GitHub
. We could instantiate the next level’s GameConfig with n_agents = survivors instead of always 100. Additionally, we’d want to carry over the breed (genetic distribution) of those survivors. Right now the code calls self.simulation.evolve_breed() at level end (which averages traits into a Breed object)
GitHub
, then uses that breed for the next level’s config
GitHub
. That maintains trait progression, but it doesn’t reduce the population. To enforce losses, we could skip auto-breeding between legs and directly reuse the surviving agents. A quick hack: get the list of survivor BirdEntities from the old simulation and manually initialize the new simulation’s population with those (and fill up with some offspring if you want to keep 100 as an upper cap). This would require exposing a method to spawn a simulation with a given list of birds or feeding the survivors into the GeneticSimulation’s breeding function with a cap. It’s non-trivial but doable – since the code already has a concept of survivors list and offspring creation, we could intercept it. For example, instead of always doing if total_candidates > max_population: ... then cutting to 100
GitHub
, we could allow fewer. We might set max_population = survivors_count from last leg when calling the breeding for the next leg (if not final breeding). This way the next level starts with that smaller number.

In summary, not refilling the flock fully between legs will make the game more challenging and aligned with expectations. Whichever approach, we should test and ensure a player can still feasibly complete the entire migration – we may need to adjust food or hazards to compensate for potentially smaller flocks in later legs.

4. Trait Evolution and Breeding Balance: The genetic trait progression seems solid (small bonuses for survivors of hazards, etc.), but one thing to watch is trait amplification over many generations. Since the game can potentially run indefinitely (if players keep succeeding), traits like speed_factor get multiplied by 1.05 for each predator “close call”
GitHub
. Over many generations, could this push some traits to their caps too fast or create unbalanced super-birds? The code caps speed_factor at 1.2
GitHub
 and other traits at 1.0 max, so that’s good. We might consider adding slight random mutations occasionally to keep diversity (the roadmap mentioned mutation rates, but I didn’t see a clear random mutation implementation in the breeding logic beyond experience bonuses). Ensuring that not all birds become identical over time can maintain the need for strategy. Another balance consideration is beacon effectiveness: with limited beacons, we increased their strength. The BeaconType.WIND_LURE (formerly “thermal”) for example now likely has a stronger push on birds. We should verify in playtesting that using a wind beacon actually creates a noticeable difference in the flock’s path – if not, we may increase its radius or effect so that spending a beacon feels worthwhile.

5. Difficulty Progression: The game is intended to get harder each migration. Presently, hazard strength does scale with migration_id (storms get +3 strength per migration, etc.)
GitHub
 and number of legs increases (up to 5 legs by migration 4). This is good. We should also perhaps scale food scarcity: later migrations might have legs so long that even with 3 food sites it’s tough to reach the next one. If we want to enforce use of evolved traits, we could shorten the distance between food in early migrations and lengthen in later ones. The code currently randomizes leg distance 800–1200 (which already might be quite tough if at upper range with only 3 food sites). We can monitor player success rate; the roadmap’s goal was ~60–80% first-time completion for early migrations
GitHub
. If it’s lower, we’ll tweak by either adding an extra food site or lowering energy burn (the energy_efficiency trait could be made more impactful to simulate better endurance in later generations).

In summary, the balance is on the right track but will need iterative tuning. Reducing early frustration (hazard insta-kills, flock flying off-screen, etc.) is priority. The fixes to camera and UI will help with frustration unrelated to design, and then tweaking numbers (hazard odds, predator behavior, refilling between legs) will make the gameplay challenge feel fair and winnable.

Level Progression & Panel Workflow Issues

1. Level Generation “Broken” (Persistence): As discussed, the multi-leg progression has a logic flaw where each leg is essentially treated as a fresh start in terms of bird count. This can feel “broken” from a gameplay continuity perspective. A player who sees only 50 birds survive a gauntlet might be confused when 100 birds appear at the next checkpoint. To fix this, we should implement true persistence of the flock across legs. The best solution is to leverage the existing MigrationManager/UnifiedSimulation more fully. The code already defines a MigrationJourney with checkpoints A, B, C...
GitHub
 and a continue_to_next_leg() that resets positions and refills energy
GitHub
. We should use that in the server flow instead of tearing down the sim each time. Concretely, after a leg is completed, rather than calling a new load_level, we can call unified_sim.continue_to_next_leg() (if using unified) or simulate that behavior by carrying survivors as described. This will make level generation feel consistent – events that happened in the prior leg (deaths, trait gains) directly affect the next leg. It also means the “panel between levels” can display accurate information. Right now the transition panel after a leg shows the number of survivors, but then the next “Start Level” panel always says “Your Flock: 50 Males, 50 Females” (since it assumes 100 birds split evenly). This is misleading when, say, only 80 actually survived. We can improve the panel data by passing the real survivor counts. The showLevelPanel() is already called with parameters for males/females
GitHub
 – we need the server to send updated values. The server’s level_loaded message currently always uses the original 100 split
GitHub
. If we carry survivors, we can adjust males and females in that message for legs beyond the first. Implementing persistence will automatically solve this: e.g. if 80 survive Leg 1, when starting Leg 2, total_birds = 80 and we send that. In code, we could capture the survivor count from the previous leg’s level_completed data (already sent as survivors
GitHub
) and use it for the next level_loaded. This would make the level start panel accurately reflect, say, “Your Flock: 40 Males, 40 Females” if 80 remain.

2. Panel Sequence and Timing: There is a slight UX timing issue at the start of the game: on connecting, the code sometimes shows the level start panel immediately (due to the onConnectionChange handler) and the server might simultaneously send a level_loaded. This caused a flicker where the panel might appear twice in quick succession (or the backdrop gets redrawn). The code attempts to handle it by using the levelStartRequested flag
GitHub
, but if the timing is off, the panel could pop up, disappear, then reappear. We should test this and, if it’s happening, simplify the logic. One approach: do not automatically show the panel on connect; rely on the level_loaded message from the server to trigger it. The server already sends level_loaded as soon as the first level is ready
GitHub
. We could remove the setTimeout call that shows the panel on connection
GitHub
 to avoid a race. This way, there’s a single source of truth for when to display the Start Level panel (the server event).

3. Continuation Flow: After a leg is complete, the Continue button triggers continueToNextLeg which sends a continue_migration message. The server then loads the next level and eventually sends a new level_loaded. Right now, the client’s logic sets a flag to avoid redisplaying the panel automatically in this case
GitHub
GitHub
. We should double-check that workflow – if any bug causes that flag not to be set or cleared properly, the panel might not show when it should, or vice versa. In testing, ensure that: (a) after clicking Continue, the next level does indeed start paused and the Start panel is shown (currently it is designed not to show because the assumption is the user just clicked start, but now it’s a new level). Actually, looking at the code: when the user clicks Continue, levelStartRequested is set to true
GitHub
, so when the new level_loaded arrives, the panel is suppressed
GitHub
. This means the next leg starts immediately without giving the player a chance to review the new leg info or catch their breath – likely not intended. The roadmap called for a pause at checkpoints. We likely want to always show the Start panel at each leg, not skip it. To fix this, we should not treat a continue as a reason to skip the panel. The levelStartRequested flag approach is appropriate for when the user has already explicitly started a level (to avoid showing the panel twice for the same leg), but on a new leg it should reset. In fact, the code does this.levelStartRequested = false after using it
GitHub
. However, because the flag is set true before sending continue_migration, the new level_loaded comes while it’s true and gets suppressed. The fix could be to move levelStartRequested = false to right before showing the panel for the new leg. E.g., in the server’s migration_continued or just on the client, simply don’t reuse levelStartRequested for continues. We can manage it more simply: always show showLevelPanel on any level_loaded for a new leg, and only use that flag to avoid an immediate panel when the player initially presses Start for leg 1. In summary, clean up the continue-to-next-leg flow so that each leg still begins with a paused state and a panel (like a checkpoint briefing). This will improve the pacing and clarity between levels.

4. Panel Data and Formatting: We touched on panel accuracy; one more tweak: The “LEVEL 1” title vs “MIGRATION LEG 1” wording can be standardized. Right now the code sets the title to "LEVEL 1" initially and then updates it to "MIGRATION LEG X" dynamically
GitHub
. It might be better to consistently call it “Leg 1, Leg 2, ...” or include the checkpoint names (the Roadmap suggested labels like A→B). We have the leg_name from the server (e.g. “Breeding Grounds to Coastal Wetlands”) which we do show as a subtitle. That’s great context; we should ensure those names update correctly each leg (they do get passed in the level_loaded data
GitHub
). If any inconsistency is found (for instance, the first panel default subtitle is “Migration Leg A-B” hardcoded, then it gets updated), we can initialize it blank and always fill from server data to avoid confusion. Also, on the completion panel, the subtitle shows “X/Y birds survived (Z%)” which is excellent feedback
GitHub
. One small bug: if zero birds die (i.e. all 100 survived), the text might read “100/100 survived (100%)” which is fine – but if all birds die, we should handle that (currently, if survivors=0, it would say “0/100 birds survived (0%)”, and presumably the game ends). Perhaps in that case we’d want a different message (“All birds were lost!” and a restart prompt) – but that veers into design choice. For now, the completion panel logic is okay, but just ensure that if survivors == 0 the game doesn’t try to proceed to next leg (the server does send a migration_complete or failure message in that case). We might want to intercept that and show a Game Over screen instead of the generic completion panel. That could be a future addition: e.g., if survivors===0, show a modal saying “Migration Failed – no survivors. Try Again.” Currently, I suspect the game just pauses on game over with no victory, and perhaps the user must manually restart. Adding a failure popup would improve UX.

In summary, addressing these panel and progression issues will make the game flow much more intuitive. The transitions will correctly reflect the state of the flock and give players proper control at checkpoints. After these fixes – correct survivor counts, camera following, single modals – the game should both look and feel far more polished and true to its design intent.

Code Snippets for Key Fixes

Below are concise code examples implementing some of the above fixes:

Default Camera Follow Mode (in GameScene.ts constructor or init):

this.cameraMode = 'flock_follow';  // start in follow mode instead of 'manual'


This one-liner ensures the camera tracks the flock immediately. No more birds wandering off-screen.

Resetting Level Panel on New Leg (part of UIScene.showLevelPanel):

if (this.isCompletionPanel && this.levelPanel) {
    this.levelPanel.destroy();
    this.levelPanel = null;
    this.isCompletionPanel = false;
}
if (!this.levelPanel) {
    this.createLevelPanel();
}
// Now update text fields for the new leg:
if (levelTitle) levelTitle.setText(`MIGRATION LEG ${levelNumber}`);
// ... etc.


This ensures a fresh panel each time. We destroy the old one if it was showing a completion, so we don’t carry over any stale state (text, colors, or the semi-transparent backdrop). Then we safely create a new panel for the upcoming leg.

Hiding BirdInspection on Level Popup (in main event handler for level loaded/completed):

// After showing the panel (level start or completion)
uiScene.showLevelPanel(...);
gameScene.hideBirdInspection();


By doing this, we proactively clean up the bird detail pop-up anytime we bring up a big modal. The hideBirdInspection() method already destroys the panel if it exists
GitHub
.

Using Survivor Count for Next Level (conceptual server-side change):
Instead of always starting each leg with 100 birds, modify continue_migration to pass survivors:

if self.current_leg < self.max_legs:
    survivors = [agent for agent in self.simulation.agents if agent.alive]
    survivor_count = len(survivors)
    self.current_leg += 1
    # ... prepare next level ID
    next_level = f"W1-{self.current_leg}"
    # Use survivors count in next level config
    config = GameConfig.from_level(next_level, seed=seed, breed=self.current_breed, n_agents=survivor_count)
    self.simulation = EvolvedSimulation(config)
    # Possibly carry over genetics of survivors into self.current_breed before this
    ...


(Note: The above is a sketch – in practice we might integrate with GeneticSimulation to carry the actual individuals. But even setting n_agents = survivor_count will make the next sim start with fewer birds.) This change will directly enforce losses to matter. We’d also adjust the UI message when loading the level to use survivor_count for males/females.

Predator Sprite Rendering (in GameScene.createHazardVisual or similar):

if (hazard.type === 'predator') {
    const predatorSprite = this.add.image(0, 0, 'predator_sprite');
    predatorSprite.setScale(0.5);
    predatorSprite.setTint(0xff4444);
    // perhaps add some tween to indicate motion or hovering
    container.add(predatorSprite);
}


This would draw the predator on the hazard container at the appropriate location. We might use a small scale and a red tint or shadow to distinguish it. Now players will see an eagle icon when a predator is present, rather than just a circle.

Level Start Panel always shown on new leg: We will remove the condition that skips the panel after continue. In practice, this means not carrying over levelStartRequested = true across legs. We can simply do:

// in onMessage handling 'level_loaded':
uiScene.showLevelPanel(...); 
// (remove the if(!levelStartRequested) check entirely for new legs)


And ensure that when the user clicks “Start Level”, we only prevent the panel from reappearing for that same level. This fix is more about reorganizing logic than code to insert, but it’s important to mention in implementation notes.

By implementing these fixes and adjustments, display issues (like overlapping pop-ups and off-camera action) will be resolved, and gameplay issues (like lack of persistence and balance quirks) will be much closer to the roadmap’s vision. The result will be a more professional, polished Murmuration game: the UI will be clean and uncluttered, the camera will always showcase the flock’s journey, and the strategic challenge of guiding a dwindling flock through perils will be properly realized. All these changes steer the project toward the impeccable look and engaging feel expected from the design documents.

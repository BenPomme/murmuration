# Murmuration: Complete Genetics-Based Migration Game - Implementation Roadmap

## üìã Project Overview

This roadmap transforms Murmuration from an automated genetic simulation into a strategic multi-generational migration game where players guide bird flocks through dangerous journeys using environmental influence, not direct control.

## üéØ Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED CORE SYSTEMS
- **Genetics Engine**: Full trait system (hazard_awareness, energy_efficiency, flock_cohesion, beacon_sensitivity, stress_resilience, leadership)
- **Evolution Mechanics**: Multi-generational breeding with trait inheritance (Generation 23+ achieved)
- **Distance-Based Energy**: Birds consume energy based on movement, not time
- **Gender System**: 50 male/50 female breeding pairs with visual differentiation
- **Real-Time Simulation**: WebSocket client-server with state synchronization
- **Basic Rendering**: Birds display with trait-based coloring and genetic information

### ‚ùå CRITICAL MISSING SYSTEMS
- **Strategic Gameplay Loop**: No player agency in migration progression
- **Environmental Food Sites**: Not visible or strategically placed for routing decisions  
- **Beacon Strategy**: Unlimited beacons with minimal influence on bird behavior
- **Level Design**: No structured A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíZ checkpoint progression
- **Hazard Integration**: Storm sprites unused, no predator chase mechanics
- **UI/UX Systems**: No bird inspection, migration results, or strategic feedback
- **Difficulty Progression**: No procedural level generation or scaling challenges
